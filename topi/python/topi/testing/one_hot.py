def one_hot(indices, on_value, off_value, depth, axis, dtype):
    """one_hot operator implemented in numpy.

    Returns a one-hot tensor where the locations repsented by indices take value on_value,
    other locations take value off_value.
    Final dimension is <indices outer dimensions> x depth x <indices inner dimensions>.

    Parameters
    ----------
    indices : numpy.ndarray
        Locations to set to on_value.

    on_value : int/float
        Value to fill at indices.

    off_value : int/float
        Value to fill at all other positions besides indices.

    depth : int
        Depth of the one-hot dimension.

    axis : int
        Axis to fill.

    dtype : str
        Data type of the output tensor.

    Returns
    -------
    ret : relay.Expr
        The one-hot tensor.
