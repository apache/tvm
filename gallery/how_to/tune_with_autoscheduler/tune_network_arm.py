Auto-scheduling a Neural Network for ARM CPU
=============================================
**Author**: `Thierry Moreau <https://github.com/tmoreau89>`_, \
            `Lianmin Zheng <https://github.com/merrymercy>`_, \
            `Chengfan Jia <https://github.com/jcf94/>`_

Auto-tuning for specific devices and workloads is critical for getting the
best performance. This is a tutorial on how to tune a whole neural
network for ARM CPU with the auto-scheduler via RPC.

To auto-tune a neural network, we partition the network into small subgraphs and
tune them independently. Each subgraph is treated as one search task.
A task scheduler slices the time and dynamically allocates time resources to
these tasks. The task scheduler predicts the impact of each task on the end-to-end
execution time and prioritizes the one that can reduce the execution time the most.

For each subgraph, we use the compute declaration in :code:`tvm/python/topi` to
get the computational DAG in the tensor expression form.
We then use the auto-scheduler to construct a search space of this DAG and search
for good schedules (low-level optimizations).

Different from the template-based :ref:`autotvm <tutorials-autotvm-sec>` which relies on
manual templates to define the search space, the auto-scheduler does not require any
schedule templates. In other words, the auto-scheduler only uses the compute declarations
in :code:`tvm/python/topi` and does not use existing schedule templates.

Note that this tutorial will not run on Windows or recent versions of macOS. To
get it to run, you will need to wrap the body of this tutorial in a :code:`if
__name__ == "__main__":` block.

# Define a Network
# ----------------
# First, we need to define the network with relay frontend API.
# We can load some pre-defined network from :code:`tvm.relay.testing`.
# We can also load models from MXNet, ONNX, PyTorch, and TensorFlow
# (see :ref:`front end tutorials<tutorial-frontend>`).
#
# For convolutional neural networks, although auto-scheduler can work correctly
# with any layout, we found the best performance is typically achieved with NHWC layout.
# We also implemented more optimizations for NHWC layout with the auto-scheduler.
# So it is recommended to convert your models to NHWC layout to use the auto-scheduler.
# You can use :ref:`ConvertLayout <convert-layout-usage>` pass to do the layout conversion in TVM.

#################################################################
# Start RPC Tracker
# -----------------
# TVM uses RPC session to communicate with ARM boards.
# During tuning, the tuner will send the generated code to the board and
# measure the speed of code on the board.
#
# To scale up the tuning, TVM uses RPC Tracker to manage distributed devices.
# The RPC Tracker is a centralized controller node. We can register all devices to
# the tracker. For example, if we have 10 phones, we can register all of them
# to the tracker, and run 10 measurements in parallel, accelerating the tuning process.
#
# To start an RPC tracker, run this command on the host machine. The tracker is
# required during the whole tuning process, so we need to open a new terminal for
# this command:
#
# .. code-block:: bash
#
#   python -m tvm.exec.rpc_tracker --host=0.0.0.0 --port=9190
#
# The expected output is
#
# .. code-block:: bash
#
#   INFO:RPCTracker:bind to 0.0.0.0:9190

#################################################################
# Register Devices to RPC Tracker
# -----------------------------------
# Now we can register our devices to the tracker. The first step is to
# build the TVM runtime for the ARM devices.
#
# * For Linux:
#   Follow this section :ref:`build-tvm-runtime-on-device` to build
#   the TVM runtime on the device. Then register the device to tracker by
#
#   .. code-block:: bash
#
#     python -m tvm.exec.rpc_server --tracker=[HOST_IP]:9190 --key=rasp4b-64
#
#   (replace :code:`[HOST_IP]` with the IP address of your host machine)
#
# * For Android:
#   Follow this `readme page <https://github.com/apache/tvm/tree/main/apps/android_rpc>`_ to
#   install the TVM RPC APK on the android device. Make sure you can pass the android rpc test.
#   Then you have already registered your device. During tuning, you have to go to developer option
#   and enable "Keep screen awake during changing" and charge your phone to make it stable.
#
# After registering devices, we can confirm it by querying rpc_tracker
#
# .. code-block:: bash
#
#   python -m tvm.exec.query_rpc_tracker --host=0.0.0.0 --port=9190
#
# For example, if we have 2 Huawei mate10 pro, 11 Raspberry Pi 4B with 64bit OS, and 2 rk3399,
# the output can be
#
# .. code-block:: bash
#
#    Queue Status
#    ----------------------------------
#    key          total  free  pending
#    ----------------------------------
#    mate10pro    2      2     0
#    rk3399       2      2     0
#    rasp4b-64    11     11    0
#    ----------------------------------
#
# You can register multiple devices to the tracker to accelerate the measurement in tuning.

###########################################
# Set Tuning Options
# ------------------
# Before tuning, we should apply some configurations. Here I use a Raspberry Pi 4b 4GB board
# as example with a 64bit OS (Ubuntu 20.04). In your setting, you should modify the target
# and device_key accordingly.
# set :code:`use_ndk` to True if you use android phone.

#### DEVICE CONFIG ####

# Replace "aarch64-linux-gnu" with the correct target of your board.
# This target is used for cross compilation. You can query it by :code:`gcc -v` on your device.
# FIXME(tmoreau89, merrymercy): We leave '-device=arm_cpu' out of the target string
#                               because we're sharing x86 op strategy.
target = tvm.target.Target("llvm -mtriple=aarch64-linux-gnu -mattr=+neon")

# Also replace this with the device key, rpc host and rpc port in your tracker
device_key = "rasp4b-64"
rpc_host = "127.0.0.1"
rpc_port = 9190

# Set this to True if you use ndk tools for cross compiling
# And also set the environment variable below to point to the cross compiler
use_ndk = False
# os.environ["TVM_NDK_CC"] = "/usr/bin/aarch64-linux-gnu-g++"

#### TUNING OPTION ####

#################################################################
# Extract Search Tasks
# --------------------
# Next, we extract the search tasks and their weights from a network.
# The weight of a task is the number of appearances of the task's subgraph
# in the whole network.
# By using the weight, we can approximate the end-to-end latency of the network
# as :code:`sum(latency[t] * weight[t])`, where :code:`latency[t]` is the
# latency of a task and :code:`weight[t]` is the weight of the task.
# The task scheduler will just optimize this objective.

# Extract tasks from the network

    print(task.compute_dag)


#################################################################
# Tuning and Evaluation
# ---------------------
# Now, we set some options for tuning and launch the search tasks
#
# * :code:`num_measure_trials` is the number of measurement trials we can use during the tuning.
#   You can set it to a small number (e.g., 200) for a fast demonstrative run.
#   In practice, we recommend setting it around :code:`800 * len(tasks)`,
#   which is typically enough for the search to converge.
#   For example, there are 29 tasks in resnet-50, so we can set it as 20000.
#   You can adjust this parameter according to your time budget.
# * In addition, we use :code:`RecordToFile` to dump measurement records into a log file,
#   The measurement records can be used to query the history best, resume the search,
#   and do more analyses later.
# * see :any:`auto_scheduler.TuningOptions`,
#   :any:`auto_scheduler.LocalRunner` for more parameters.
#
# After auto-tuning, we can compile the network with the best schedules we found.
# All measurement records are dumped into the log file during auto-tuning,
# so we can read the log file and load the best schedules.

######################################################################
# .. note:: Terminate the tuning earlier
#
#   You can terminate the tuning earlier by forcibly killing this process.
#   As long as you get at least one valid schedule for each task in the log file,
#   you should be able to do the compilation (the secion below).
#

#################################################################
# Other Tips
# ----------
# 1. During the tuning, the auto-scheduler needs to compile many programs and
#    extract feature from them. This part is CPU-intensive,
#    so a high-performance CPU with many cores is recommended for faster search.
# 2. You can use :code:`python3 -m tvm.auto_scheduler.measure_record --mode distill -i log.json`
#    to distill the large log file and only save the best useful records.
# 3. You can resume a search from the previous log file. You just need to
#    add a new argument :code:`load_log_file` when creating the task scheduler
#    in function :code:`run_tuning`. Say,
#    :code:`tuner = auto_scheduler.TaskScheduler(tasks, task_weights, load_log_file=log_file)`
# 4. If you have multiple target CPUs, you can use all of them for measurements to
#    parallelize the measurements. Check this :ref:`section <tutorials-autotvm-scale-up-rpc-tracker>`
#    to learn how to use the RPC Tracker and RPC Server.
#    To use the RPC Tracker in auto-scheduler, replace the runner in :code:`TuningOptions`
#    with :any:`auto_scheduler.RPCRunner`.
