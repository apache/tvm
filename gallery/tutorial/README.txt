User Tutorial
-------------

This tutorial provides an introduction to TVM, meant to address user who is new
to the TVM project. It begins with some basic information on how TVM works,
then works through installing TVM, compiling and optimizing models, then
digging in deeper to the Tensor Expression language and the tuning and
optimization tools that are built on top of it. After completing the tutorial,
a new user should be familiar enough with TVM to optimize models, and will be
prepared to dig into TVM more deeply.
