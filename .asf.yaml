  # Triage perm for collaborators(test run)
  #
  # The perm is given based on needs and not based on
  # evaluation of past contributions. The rationale
  # is that people may need the permission to start
  # contributing in this way. It serves to diversify
  # the ways to contribute.
  #
  # There is a limited number of slots. To enable broad
  # participation, permission is given on a three month
  # cycle. PMC may review and recycle slots when necessary.
