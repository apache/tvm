# Variables used by this module, they can change the default behaviour and need
# to be set before calling find_package:
#
#  NCCL_ROOT - When set, this path is inspected instead of standard library
#              locations as the root of the NCCL installation.
#              The environment variable NCCL_ROOT overrides this variable.
#
# This module defines
#  Nccl_FOUND, whether nccl has been found
#  NCCL_INCLUDE_DIR, directory containing header
#  NCCL_LIBRARY, directory containing nccl library
# This module assumes that the user has already called find_package(CUDA)
