# OpenCL Wrapper

This wrapper helps dynamically loading OpenCL library. It allows us to avoid of
looking for and copying library from phone to host, looking for OpenCL SDK.

This can be done because OpenCL is a standard and number of functions are
limited. We can safely wrap all required functions and their number will not
grow.
