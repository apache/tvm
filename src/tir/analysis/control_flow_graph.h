/*!
 * \brief Represents the flow of control through a `tir::Stmt`
 *
 * This class contains an internal representation of the possible
 * control flow that may occur during execution of a `tir::Stmt`.  It
 * consists of a collection of ControlFlowBlock objects, each of which
 * represents a subset of operations performed during execution, along
 * with edges that represent allowed transitions between
 * `ControlFlowBlock`.
 *
 * In addition, the following restrictions are used.
 *
 * 1. Each block may have at most two predecessors, and at most two
 *    successors.
 *
 * 2. Within each block, values stored in a buffer do not change.
 *    That is, encountering a `BufferStore` node requires creating a
 *    new block.
 *
 * For example, consider the following PrimFunc
 *
 * \code{.py}
 * @T.prim_func
 * def func(T.Buffer(16, "float32")):
 *     for i in T.serial(16):
 *         if i < 8:
 *              B[i] = i
 *         else:
 *              B[i] = i-8
 * \endcode
 *
 * The control flow graph would have eight control blocks.
 *
 * 1. function_entry, from the start of the function through the
 *    evaluation of the loop's extent.
 *
 *    Predecessors: n/a
 *    Successors: loop_start
 *
 * 2. loop_start, after entering the body of the loop, through the
 *    evaluation of the conditional `i < 8`
 *
 *    Predecessors: function_entry, after_conditional
 *    Successors: then_clause_start, else_clause_start
 *
 * 3. then_clause_start, after entering the then_clause of `i < 8`,
 *    through evaluation of the value `i`.
 *
 *    Predecessors: loop_start
 *    Successors: then_clause_end
 *
 * 4. then_clause_end, after storing to `B[i]` prior to exiting the
 *    then_clause.
 *
 *    Predecessors: then_clause_start
 *    Successors: after_conditional
 *
 * 5. else_clause_start, after entering the else_clause of `i < 8`,
 *    through evaluation of the value `i-8`.
 *
 *    Predecessors: loop_start
 *    Successors: else_clause_end
 *
 * 6. else_clause_end, after storing to `B[i]` prior to exiting the
 *    else_clause.
 *
 *    Predecessors: else_clause_start
 *    Successors: after_conditional
 *
 * 7. after_conditional, after the end of the if/then/else, before the
 *    end of the loop body
 *
 *    Predecessors: then_clause_end, else_clause_end
 *    Successors: loop_start, after_loop
 *
 * 8. after_loop, after the loop
 *
 *    Predecessors: after_conditional
 *    Successors: n/a
 *
 *
 * By identifying `BufferStore` nodes whose value does not depend on
 * values stored in input buffers (e.g. initializing `buf[i] = 0.0`),
 * or whose values are provided using `builtin::assume()`
 * (e.g. `T.assume(buf[i] == 0.0)`), the value stored in a buffer at
 * those indices may be known for a given control block.  These known
 * values can then be propagated forward to successor blocks, to be
 * used in context-dependent simplifications.
 *
 * In addition to the allowed transitions between control-flow
 * blocks, each block also tracks the buffer touch points; which
 * indices are read from a buffer, which values are written to which
 * indices of a buffer, and assumptions are provided using
 * `builtin::assume()`; that occur during the control-flow block.
 *
 * Note: The current implementation only tracks the values of
 * buffers that are constrained to a specific value, and does not
 * track inequalities that may partially constrain buffer values.
 * That is, entering a scoped context with a data-dependent equality
 * condition (e.g. `if buf[i] == value`) is tracked, but entering a
 * scoped context with a data-dependent inequality condition
 * (e.g. `if buf[i] > value`) is not tracked.
