 * \details This primitive selects the outermost rollable axis with a positive bound overlap that
 * appears in the block's ancestor loops as `rolling axis`, fold and circularize the buffer along
 * the rolling dimension, append block predicate to avoid recomputing overlapping elements.
 * It requires:
 * 1) The buffer to be an intermediate buffer defined via `alloc_buffer`.
 * 2) The LCA of the producer and consumer of the buffer is a for loop, typically,
 *    the producer and consumer of the buffer are cascaded through compute_at.
 * 3) The access region of the buffer has at least one dimension that contains
 *    a positive bound overlap.
 * \param block_rv The producer block of the buffer.
 * \param write_buffer_index The index of the buffer in block's write region.
