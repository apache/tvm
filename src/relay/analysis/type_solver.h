/*!
 * \brief Interface of type solver used in type inference.
 *
 * TypeSolver works on a list of constraints among incomplete types.
 * The user will populate the constraints by AddConstraint and Assign.
 * Then we can call Solve to trying to resolve the unknown.
 *
 * This can be viewed as "type program(computational graph)" of types, where
 * the type constraint are operators of the graph and the incomplete
 * types are intermediate value of the graph.
 * If all the input types are concretely known, we should be able to
 * just run a forward pass on the "type program" to get all the types.
 *
 * The list of constraints representation means we are storing it as a bipartite
 * graph instead of a DAG. This is because some constraints might go both direction.
 * TypeSolver could take advantage of bidirectional constraints to deduce input
 * value given output ones. Never-the-less, we should keep in mind that
 * there is a "forward direction" that the TypeSolver should take advantage of.
