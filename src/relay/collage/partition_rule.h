/*!
 * \brief Base class of all partition rules.
 *
 * A \p PartitionRule describes how to find a set of \p CandidatePartitions for a \p DataflowGraph.
 * The candidates are allowed to overlap, and ultimately it is the job of the Collage searcher to
 * find a selection of candidates which covers the whole Relay expression without overlap. Partition
 * rules are paired with their \p Target and other 'top level' configuration in a \p PartitionSpec.
 *
 * We provide a set of 'base' partition rules which produce candidates from the dataflow graph
 * directly. We also provide a set of 'combinator' partition rules which can produce new candidates
 * from the results of an arbitrary sub-rule or sub-rules. By mixing these base and combinator
 * rules we can express a wide variety of partition strategies and encoding conventions.
 *
 * There may be many thousands of candidates in flight during the Collage search. We take care to
 * defer constructing or rewriting Relay expressions until absolutely necessary. We only pay for
 * extracting a function to represent a candidate when we need to measure it's cost. And we only
 * pay for rewriting the overall Relay expression to commit to a partitioning when the Collage
 * search has completed.
 *
 * The base rules implemented so far:
 *  - \p DFPatternPartitionRule: Given a \p DFPattern and expression predicate, produces a candidate
 *    for every sub-graph matched by the pattern and predicate. Unlike the \p PatternRewriter,
 *    candidates are free to overlap. Used to bring BYOC patterns into the Collage framework.
 *  - \p OpCallByKindPartitionRule: Uses the "TOpPattern" attribute provided for every Relay
 *    operator to produce a candidate for every call to a 'fusable Relay operator'. Used to
 *    look ahead to how TVM will fuse sub-graphs.
 *
 * The combinator rules implemented so far:
 *  - \p CompositePartitionRule: Indicates all candidates matched by the sub-rule should be wrapped
 *    by a "Composite" function. The "Composite" name is taken from the rule name. Used to indicate
 *    Relay operators (or groups of Relay operators) should be mapped to target-specific operators,
 *    both for BYOC and TVM external library integrations.
 *  - \p PrimitivePartitionRule: Indicates all candidates matched by the sub-rule should be wrapped
 *    by a "Primitive" function, possibly with an additional "Compiler" attribute. Used to
 *    delineate a partition (or kernel).
 *  - \p UnionPartitionRule: Simply unions all the candidates from all sub-rules together. Used to
 *    combine individual \p DFPatternPartitionRules.
 *  - \p CombinePartitionRule: Given a sub-rule and a list of 'combiner' rules, finds
 *    all possible ways of combining the sub-rule's candidates to yield even larger candidates.
 *    Note that the sub-rule's candidates may also be directly included in the results. The
 *    'combiner' rules allow combining by \p OpPatternKinds, combining the arguments to tuples
 *    which themselves are arguments to Relay operator calls, and so on. This rule is intended to
 *    mimic the existing TVM \p FuseOps pass, though:
 *    i) all candidates are found rather than just the largest, ii) the starting set of candidates
 *    can be provided by any other rule, and iii) we rely on \p SubGraph validity checking to weed
 *    out infeasible candidates.
 *  - \p OnlyValidPartitionRule: Given a \p SubGraphConfig, ignores candidates with 'invalid'
 *    sub-graphs. Used to limit the maximum candidate depth, the number of independent outputs,
 *    and whether intermediate 'taps' are allowed.
 *  - \p HostPartitionRule: Produces candidates for all Relay expressions which could be
 *    'left behind' for execution by the host (eg on the VM). This rule lets us simplify the
 *    overall Collage search algorithm.
 *
 * (Though not yet implemented, we'd like to allow a combinator rule which will union candidate
 * based on their 'anchor' operators. This can be used to implement 'vertical' and 'horizontal'
 * partition on more primitive candidates. Note that the \p SubGraph machinery supports
 * multiple-input and -output sub-graphs and their validation, so horizontal partition is easy
 * implement.)
 *
 * Here are some typical ways to combine \p PartitionRules for different partition/fusion
 * strategies:
 *
 *  - Classic pattern-based BYOC with \p MergeComposite/AnnotateTarget/PartitionGraph passes:
 *    \code
 *    PrimitivePartitionRule
 *      OnlyValidPartitionRule
 *        CombinePartitionRule (with join-anything combiner rule)
 *          UnionPartitionRule
 *            CompositePartitionRule(label1)
 *              DFPatternPartitionRule(pattern1)
 *                        :
 *            CompositePartitionRule(labeln)
 *              DFPatternPartitionRule(patternn)
 *    \endcode
 *
 *  - "Consider this library implementation for these sub-expressions", using \p DFPatterns to
 *    pick out which Relay operators are supported:
 *    \code
 *    OnlyValidPartitionRule
 *      CombinePartitionRule (with default TVM combiner rules)
 *        UnionPartitionRule
 *          OpCallByKindPartitionRule
 *          CompositePartitionRule(lable1)
 *            DFPatternPartitionRule(pattern1)
 *                       :
 *          CompositePartitionRule(lablen)
 *            DFPatternPartitionRule(patternn)
 *    \endcode
 *
 *  - Classic TVM \p FuseOps
 *    \code
 *    PrimitivePartitionRule
 *      OnlyValidPartitionRule
 *        CombinePartitionRule (with default TVM combiner rules)
 *          OpCallByKindPartitionRule
 *    \endcode
 *
 *  - "Just fuse what I tell you to fuse", using \p DFPatterns to directly select candidates:
 *    \code
 *    PrimitivePartitionRule
 *      OnlyValidPartitionRule
 *        UnionPartitionRule
 *          DFPatternPartitionRule(pattern1)
 *                       :
 *          DFPatternPartitionRule(patternn)
 *    \endcode

/*!
 * \brief Partition rule which combines sub-graphs to exploit optimizations commonly available in
 * backends (including the TVM lowering backend). Those optimization rules are in turn described by
 * one or more primitive \p CombinerRules.
 *
 * For TVM these primitive combiner rules are guided by the \p OpPatternKind associated with every
 * sub-graph. That in turn is the maximum of the kind of each expression node in the sub-graph,
 * using the rules:
 *  - Constants are \p kElemwise.
 *  - A call to a Relay operator has the kind of its callee.
 *  - Tuple construction and projection are injective provided all tuple fields are of tensor type.
 *  - All other sub-expressions are opaque.
 *
 * The available \p OpPatternKinds (and our abbreviations for them) are:
 *  - E: kElemWise, eg nn.relu
 *  - B: kBroadcast, eg add
 *  - I: kInjective, eg concatenate
 *  - R: kCommReduce, eg sum
 *  - A: kOutEWiseFusable, eg nn.conv2d (often called 'anchor nodes', hence the A abbreviation)
 *  - O: kOpaque, everything else
 * (The kTuple kind is not used by this machinery.)
 *
 * Kinds are ordered as above from least- to most-constraining w.r.t. possible partition
 * opportunities. When we write a kind abbreviation below we intend it to mean that kind *or less*.
 * And when when write 'kl -> kr' we mean it to match a sub-expression of kind kr or less who's
 * dataflow inputs are all of kind kl or less.
 *
 * We can then mimic the classic \p FuseOps TVM Pass with the following more primitive combiner
 * rules:
 *  - Sub-groups cannot have taps. In the classic \p FuseOps pass taps are avoided by construction
 *    by always considering all node->dominator paths. Here we naively allow taps on all candidates,
 *    but reject them using SubGraph::IsValid with a SubGraphConfig with allow_taps = false.
 *  - Combine A -> B
 *  - Combine B -> R
 *  - Combine I -> I
 *  - Combine I -> tuple -> I. That is, if an I sub-graph has a tuple as input, and at least one
 *    tuple field can be provided by an I sub-graph exit, then both the tuple and all such fields
 *    may be joined.
 gt*
 * Note that \p FuseOps only considers the largest possible sub-graphs. However this partition rule
 * considers all possibilities so as to 'make room' for other targets supplying other
 * overlapping candidates.
 *
 * See combiner_rule.h for the more primitive combiner rules which implement the above.
