 * \brief Helper passes for working with functions with the "Compiler" attribute.
 *
 * Those wishing to use the "RelayToTIR" custom pass machinery to do IRModule-at-a-time external
 * codegen may find the following helpers useful:
 *
 *  - The \p OutlineCompilerFunctionsWithExistingGlobalSymbols pass will lift inline functions with
 *    a matching "Compiler" attribute to be global functions, using the "global_symbol" attribute
 *    already assigned. Can be used before custom lowering.
 *
 *    Note that ideally "Compiler" attributed functions would be made global functions as early as
 *    possible and would stay that way. However, the GraphExecutorCodegen and AOTExecutorCodegen
 *    assume the entire model can be represented by a single 'main' function, and the Inline pass
 *    is run to respect that assumption. So this pass is mostly just to undo that Pass after modules
 *    have passed through the 'codegen' keyhole.
 *
 *    See also OutlineCompilerFunctionsMutator in src/relay/backend/contrib/ethosu/codegen.cc.
 *
 *  - (The \p OutlineCompilerFunctions pass is a more general version of the above which can use
 *    a custom cache to both allocate "global_symbol" names and ensure two structurally equal
 *    functions are assigned the same name, and thus lowered only once. This is used by Collage
 *    when preparing the optimally partitioned IRModule).
 *
 *  - The \p MarkCompilerFunctionsAsExtern pass will update the attributes of global functions
 *    with a matching "Compiler" attribute to have just the "Extern" attribute. That will signal
 *    the function has been dealt with. However calls to such functions will be left unchanged.
 *    Can be used after lowering to cleanup the IRModule.
 *
 *  - The \p InlineCompilerFunctions pass can selectively inline global functions with a matching
 *    "Compiler" attribute who's name appears in the given set. Obviously it's more sensible to
 *    not create that function in the first place, however some external codegen have rules to
 *    accept or reject partitionings based on the overall partitioned function body. This pass
 *    can be used do the legwork, and will take care to not only inline the outer "Compiler"
 *    annotated funcition, but also any "Composite" annotated functions in its body.
