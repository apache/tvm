 * \brief This file serves as the entry point of Disco and defines key data structures and
 * interfaces.
 *
 * Disco is a distributed runtime that consists of a controler and a cluster of workers. The
 * controler is responsible for managing the workers by broadcasting commands to all the workers
 * together, and the workers are responsible for executing the commands and. The controler and
 * workers communicate with each other through a bi-directional channel.
 *
 * Different from a generic system, Disco is designed to as "single-program-multiple-data" (SPMD)
 * runtime, which means that all the workers execute the same instruction at the same time, but the
 * data they are working on may be different. For example, in data parallelism, each worker may
 * work on a different batches of the data, but they all execute the same set of instructions.
 * Therefore, imagine there is a virtual machine that executes the program, the structures of
 * workers' register files could be considered as "identical" (single program) although the values
 * may differ (multiple data).
 *
 * **DRef.** Following the design above, consider the program in SPMD in a virtual ISA, then each
 * worker is a virtual machine instance to execute the ISA maintaining its own register file.
 * The controler denotes each of their register files with a unique integer "register id",
 * and the workers use this id to refer to the register file that resides on itself.
 * DRef is a control-side object backed by such a register id. The data it contains is not assumed
 * to be directly accessible by the controler, with an exception for worker-0, which is a special
 * worker that is always co-located with the controler.
 *
 * **Worker-0.** Worker-0 is a special worker that is always co-located with the controler.
 * It is assumed that the controler can synchronize with and access the registers of worker-0.
 * The Disco session provides multiple APIs to interact specifically with the worker-0.
 * To shared data with other workers, a common paradigm in Disco is to copy data from the
 * controler-side NDArray to the worker-0, and then copy it to other workers using primitives on
 * the data plane, for example, `broadcast` and `send`.
 *
 * **Control plane.** The controler broadcasts commands to all the workers as control signals.
 * For example, the control may ask all workers to load a library or call a function respectively.
 * Common control signals include: shutdown, retrievel a global PackedFunc, call packed function,
 * etc. The controler is assumed to keep a message channel to each worker to implement the broadcast
 * behavior, and the message channel may vary depends on usecases.
 *
 * **Data plane.** The data channel is usually used to exchange data between workers, especially for
 * tensor data which is usually large. For example, performing an allreduce operator for sharded
 * matrix multiplication, or broadcasting for an input tensor. For efficiency, the data channel is
 * usually backed by NCCL on NVIDIA GPUs, RCCL on AMD GPUs, or MPI on CPUs.
 *
 * **Session.** A Disco session is a primary interface to interact with the Disco runtime, serving
 * as a global context that manages the control and workers. It could be implemented as a
 * multi-threaded with a pool of workers for single-node multi-gpu scenarios, or TCP sockets for
 * workloads that span over a cluster of nodes.
 *
 * **Channel.** Disco channel is a bi-directional communication channel between the controler and
 * workers for exchanging control signals. It is no different from a generic RPC channel, but
 * adopts TVM's PackedFunc calling convention to support polymorphic and variadic arguments.
