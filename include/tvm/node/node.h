 * \brief Definitions and helper macros for IR/AST nodes.
 *
 *  The node folder contains base utilities for IR/AST nodes,
 *  invariant of which specific language dialect.
 *
 *  We implement AST/IR nodes as sub-classes of runtime::Object.
 *  The base class Node is just an alias of runtime::Object.
 *
 *  Besides the runtime type checking provided by Object,
 *  node folder contains additional functionalities such as
 *  reflection and serialization, which are important features
 *  for building a compiler infra.
