TVM_DLL Pass UnifiedStaticMemoryPlanner();

/*!
 * \brief This pass transforms annotated loops into pipelined ones where producers and consumers
 * are overlapped with the information provided in loop annotations, which enables optimization
 * techniques like prefetching and pipeline parallelism.
 *
 * The pipeline scope consists of the direct children of the annotated loop (ignoring BlockRealize,
 * Block, SeqStmt), and the number of children is denoted by `n` in the documentation.
 *
 * The following annotations are used to guide the loop transformation:
 *
 * 1) Loop annotation `software_pipeline_stage` defines the pipeline stage.
 * An array of `n` integers, and each element should be in range [0, max_stage],
 * where max_stage is the maximum (inclusive) stage.
 * 2) Loop annotation `software_pipeline_order` defines the pipeline order.
 * An array of `n` integers, a permutation of [0, 1, ..., num_components - 1];
 * 3) Block annotation `double_buffer_scope` controls certain buffer sizes to allow decoupling of
 * read/write dependency. It's an integer index of the write regions of the block.
 *
 * Every annotated loop is transformed into a loop with three blocks as its direct children:
 *
 * 1) Prologue block, where components whose stage is less than `max_stage` is executed;
 *
 * 2) Body block, where all the components are executed;
 *
 * 3) Epilogue block, where only components whose stage is greater than 0 will be executed.
 * The execution order is controlled by the annotation `software_pipeline_order`,
 * and thus could be different than the original order.
 *
 * Note: For nested software pipelines, the inner software pipeline will be generated first,
 * which may affect the number of the direct children of the outer loop.
 * In this case, the annotations for the outer software
 * pipeline should include the result of the inner software pipeline,
 * which is the three blocks as discussed above.
 * Example:
 *
 * Before this pass, the TIR is:
 *
 * \code{.py}
 * @T.prim_func
 * def before_transform(A: T.Buffer((16, 16), "float32"), C: T.Buffer((16, 16), "float32")) -> None:
 *     for tx in T.thread_binding(0, 16, thread="threadIdx.x"):
 *         for i in T.serial(0, 16,
 *                           annotations={"software_pipeline_stage": [0, 1],
 *                                        "software_pipeline_order": [0, 1]}
 *                          ):
 *             with T.block():
 *                 T.reads(A[tx, i])
 *                 T.writes(C[tx, i])
 *                 B = T.alloc_buffer((16, 1), dtype="float32", scope="shared")
 *                 with T.block("B"):
 *                     T.reads(A[tx, i])
 *                     T.writes(B[tx, 0])
 *                     B[tx, 0] = A[tx, i] * T.float32(2)
 *                 with T.block("C"):
 *                     T.reads(B[tx, 0])
 *                     T.writes(C[tx, i])
 *                     C[tx, i] = B[tx, 0] + T.float32(1)
 * \endcode
 *
 * The TIR above annotates the loop as a two-stage pipeline with no reordering.
 * After applying this pass, the TIR is transformed into:
 *
 * \code{.py}
 * @T.prim_func
 * def after_transform(A: T.Buffer((16, 16), "float32"), C: T.Buffer((16, 16), "float32")) -> None:
