 * op_pattern details as part of the PrimFunc. This pass is Adreno specific and annotates each
 * BindingVar with appropriate HintInDevice. RealizeVDevice pass followed by handles these hints.
 * Followed by this pass we also invoke SpecializePrimFuncBasedOnCallSite which updates the
 * var_buffer_map based on this new VDevice information.
