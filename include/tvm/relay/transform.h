 * \file tvm/relay/transform.h
 *
 * This file implements a pass manager. The pass manager manages a sequence
 * of Relay-to-Relay transformation passes over a particlar unit of AST. The
 * design is largely inspired from LLVM's pass manager and modern deep learning
 * frameworks that perform tensor->tensor transformations.
 *
 * The responsibilities of a traditional compiler pass manager usually involves:
 *  - Organizing the execution order of optimization passes though not
 * necessarily in the optimal sequence.
 *  - Collecting required analysis information and keep them up-to-date.
 *  - Reducing the effort required to implement new passes for compiler
 * developers, etc.
 *
 * Similar to LLVM's pass manager, we designed the Relay pass manager to work
 * different granularity, i.e. module level, function level, and even sequential
 * passe that contains a host of passes.
 *
 * However, we also extend the functionality of the traditional pass manager
 * with the consideration of requirements/convention from deep learning
 * frameworks, such as Pytorch and Gluon, etc. Each pass in the Relay pass
 * manager performs the Relay.Module -> Relay.Module transformation. All
 * different types of passes, including the sequential-level pass object, are
 * essentially pass objects. This design, therefore, effectively provides users
 * a consistent and convenient interface, i.e. Pass, to play with. It offers a
 * means to ease the development and testing of Relay passes. For example, with
 * the pass manager, external users will be able to have custom passes correctly
 * scheduled without having to modify a single handcrafted pass order.
 *
 * In the future we need to describe constraints between passes. For example,
 * we may want to preserve dependencies between different passes and validate
 * them on the completion of a certain pass.
 *
 * We also need to store side information and import the error reporting system.
