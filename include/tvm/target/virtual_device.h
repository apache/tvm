 * \brief Describes at compile time the constraints on where data is to be stored at runtime
 * down to the (virtual) device and memory scope level, and how to compile code to compute that
 * data. Used by the \p PlanDevices pass to collect and solve (virtual) device constraints for
 * the whole Relay program.
 *
 * Is a quadruple of:
 * - A \p device_type (\p DLDeviceType). May be \p kInvalidDeviceType if unconstrained.
 * - A \p virtual_device_id (\p int). This allows us to distinguish distinct devices
 *   with the same \p Target, for example in a multi-GPU system. May be -1 if unconstrained.
 *   See "Virtual Devices" below.
 * - A \p target (\p Target) describing how to compile code for the intended device. May be null
 *   if unconstrained.
 * - A \p memory_scope (\p MemoryScope, which is currently just \p String) describing which memory
 *   area is to be used to hold data. May be "" if unconstrained. See "Memory Scopes and Devices"
 *   below.
 *
 * Some or all of these fields may be unconstrained, signaling that device planning is free to
 * choose a value consistent with the whole program. However if a \p target is given then the \p
 * device_type must equal \p target->GetTargetDeviceType().
 *
 * Note that currently we assume if a function returns its result on a particular (virtual) device
 * then the function body is also executed on that device. See the overview comment in
 * src/relay/transforms/device_planner.cc for more details.
 *
 * By 'data' we include both tensors and additional supporting datastructures such as shapes,
 * Relay ADT items (including tuples), Relay references, and Relay closures. Typically non-tensor
 * data must reside on a 'CPU'-like host device with good support for scalars.
 *
 * By 'execution' we include both (fused) primitive operators, and all the Relay expressions
 * surrounding them which coordinates data and control flow. Again, typically non-primitive
 * operators must be executed on a 'CPU'-like device with good support for control flow.
 *
 * Since TVM targets such a wide range of systems it is not possible for \p VirtualDevice to impose
 * much semantics on these fields, particularly for \p virtual_device_id and \p memory_scope.
 * Instead we assume downstream passes and codegen will interpret an validate these fields
 * appropriately.
 *
 * Targets vs Devices
 * ------------------
 * Generally \p Targets (a compile-time only datastructue) describe compiler options for a specific
 * microarchitecture and toolchain, while \p Devices (a runtime datastructure also available at
 * compile time) describe a physical device on the target system. Obviously the target must agree
 * with the device's microarchitecture, but we otherwise don't impose any constraints between them:
 *  - It's ok to use different \p Targets for the same \p Device, eg to squeeze some extra perf
 *    out of a particular primitive using particular compiler flags.
 *  - It's ok to use the same \p Target for multiple \p Devices, eg if we have multiple CPUs.
 *
 * Traditionally TVM assumes at most one \p Target per \p DLDeviceType. We are moving away from that
 * assumption.
 *
 * Virtual vs Physical Devices
 * ---------------------------
 * The \p virtual_device_id may be used by downstream passes or the runtime to help decide which
 * \p device_id to use for a particular physical runtime \p Device. For example:
 *  - Some runtimes may support passing in an array of actual `device` specifications, and the
 *    \p virtual_device_id can be used at runtime as an index into that array.
 *  - Some runtimes may support dynamically allocating computations to physical devices. On these
 *    systems a large space of \p virtual_device_ids could be used at compile time, even though
 *    at runtime only a few physical devices will be present.
 *
 * The \p virtual_device_id may also be left unconstrained if not needed.
 *
 * Memory Scopes and Devices
 * -------------------------
 * Multi-device systems can have complex memory hierarchies. For example
 * \code
 * (kDLCPU, 0, "llvm", "global")
 * \endcode
 * and
 * \code
 * (kDLCPU, 1, "llvm", "global")
 * \endcode
 * could denote:
 * - The same memory area accessible from two separate CPUs without any CPU affinity;
 * - Distinct memory areas in a NUMA architecture for which cross-device access is handled
 *   by the memory system;
 * - Outright distinct memory areas, where one device cannot directly address the memory of
 *   another.
 *
 * Similarly:
 * \code
 * (kDLCPU, 0, "llvm", "global")
 * \endcode
 * and
 * \code
 * (kDLCUDA, 0, "cuda", "host")
 * \endcode
 * could denote the same memory area, but with very different access costs.
 *
 * Furthermore, not all memory scopes are accessible to all devices, and it is possible for
 * a memory scope to only be accessible to a device when code is compiled with particular
 * \p Target options.
 *
 * \p VirtualDevices themselves have no system-level understanding. Currently the \p PlanDevices
 * pass will simply insert "device_copy" operators wherever \p VirtualDevices are not exactly
 * pointwise equal. We may revisit this in the future as the work on memory pools matures.
 *
 * Joining and Defaulting
 * ----------------------
 * It is possible to 'join' two \p VirtualDevices to yield the most constrained \p VirtualDevice
 * which agrees with both join arguments. Eg:
 * \code
 * Join((kDLCPU, -1, "llvm", ""), (kInvalidDeviceType, 3, null, "global))
 *   => (kDLCPU, 3, "llvm", "global")
 * Join((kDLCPU, -1, "llvm", ""), (kInvalidDeviceType, 3, null, "local))
 *   => null (no join possible)
 * \endcode
 *
 * Related to 'join' is 'default', which only takes constrained fields from the rhs when the
 * lhs is unconstrained:
 * \code
 * Default(kDLCPU, -1, "llvm", "local"), (kDLCPU, 3, null, "global"))
 *   => (kDLCPU, 3, "llvm", "local")
 * \endcode
 *
 * These operations are needed during device planning.
