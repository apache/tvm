Apache TVM is a compiler stack for deep learning systems. It is designed to close the gap between the
productivity-focused deep learning frameworks, and the performance- and efficiency-focused hardware backends.
TVM works with deep learning frameworks to provide end to end compilation to different backends.

License
-------
TVM is licensed under the [Apache-2.0](LICENSE) license.

Getting Started
---------------
Check out the [TVM Documentation](https://tvm.apache.org/docs/) site for installation instructions, tutorials, examples, and more.
The [Getting Started with TVM](https://tvm.apache.org/docs/tutorial/introduction.html) tutorial is a great
place to start.

Contribute to TVM
-----------------
TVM adopts apache committer model, we aim to create an open source project that is maintained and owned by the community.
Check out the [Contributor Guide](https://tvm.apache.org/docs/contribute/).

Acknowledgement
---------------
We learned a lot from the following projects when building TVM.
- [Halide](https://github.com/halide/Halide): Part of TVM's TIR and arithmetic simplification module
  originates from Halide. We also learned and adapted some part of lowering pipeline from Halide.
- [Loopy](https://github.com/inducer/loopy): use of integer set analysis and its loop transformation primitives.
- [Theano](https://github.com/Theano/Theano): the design inspiration of symbolic scan operator for recurrence.
