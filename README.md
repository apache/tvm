Apache(incubating) TVM is an open deep learning compiler stack for CPUs, GPUs, and specialized accelerators. It aims to close the gap between the productivity focused deep learning frameworks, and the performance or efficiency oriented hardware backends. TVM provides the following main features:

* Compilation of deep learning models in Keras, MXNet, PyTorch, TensorFlow, TFLite, CoreML, ONNX, Caffe2, DarkNet into minimum deployable modules on diverse hardware backends.
* Infrastructure to automatically generate and optimize tensor operators on more backend with better performance.

Acknowledgement
---------------
We learned a lot from the following projects when building TVM.
- [Halide](https://github.com/halide/Halide): Part of TVM's TIR and arithmetic simplification module
  originates from Halide. We also learned and adapted some part of lowering pipeline from Halide.
- [Loopy](https://github.com/inducer/loopy): use of integer set analysis and its loop transformation primitives.
- [Theano](https://github.com/Theano/Theano): the design inspiration of symbolic scan operator for recurrence.
