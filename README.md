TVM is a compiler stack for deep learning systems. It is designed to close the gap between the
productivity-focused deep learning frameworks, and the performance- and efficiency-focused hardware backends.
TVM works with deep learning frameworks to provide end to end compilation to different backends.
Checkout the [tvm stack homepage](http://tvm.ai/)  for more information.

Acknowledgement
---------------
We learnt a lot from the following projects when building TVM.
- [Halide](https://github.com/halide/Halide): TVM uses [HalideIR](https://github.com/dmlc/HalideIR) as data structure for
  arithematic simplification and low level lowering. We also learnt and adapted some part of lowering pipeline from Halide.
- [Loopy](https://github.com/inducer/loopy): use of integer set analysis and its loop transformation primitives.
- [Theano](https://github.com/Theano/Theano): the design inspiration of symbolic scan operator for recurrence.
