#### Codegen Backends and Runtime

- LLVM backend: recover LLVM support on windows; support target feature strings in function attributes; atomic support in NVPTX, ROCm; LLVM compatibility to LLVM 12+ [#9305](https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/9305) [#9223](https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/9223) [#9138](https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/9138) [#8860](https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/8860) [#8958](https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/8958) [#6763](https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/6763) [#6698](https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/6698) [#6717](https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/6717) [#6738](https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/6738) [#8293](https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/8293) [#6907](https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/6907) [#7051](https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/7051)
- ROCm 3.9 bitcode files search [#6865](https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/6865)
- Vulkan and SPIR-V refactoring and major improvement in codegen and runtime. [A critical bug fix in SPIRV codegen](https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/8102) allows the Vulkan backend to produce correct outputs on more hardwares and drivers. Added support for querying device specific hardware parameters and capabilities, dynamic shapes, irregular ops such as sorting and NMS, UBO, fp16, and vectorization. We can now run complicated models like MaskRCNN on Vulkan end to end.

## 0.6

### Relay in Production
Relay is a functional, differentiable programming language designed to be an expressive intermediate representation for machine learning systems. Relay supports algebraic data types, closures, control flow, and recursion, allowing it to directly represent more complex models than computation graph-based IRs (e.g., NNVM) can. In TVM v0.6, Relay is in stable phase and is ready for production.

* Algebraic Data Types (ADT) support (#2442, #2575). ADT provides an expressive, efficient, and safe way to realize recursive computation (e.g., RNN). Refer to https://tvm.apache.org/docs/langref/relay_adt.html for more information.
* Pass manager for Relay (#2546, #3226, #3234, #3191)
* Most frameworks have been supported in Relay, including ONNX, Keras, Tensorflow, Caffe2, CoreML, NNVMv1, MXNet (#2246).
* Explicitly manifest memory and tensor allocations in Relay. (#3560)

### Relay Virtual Machine
The Relay Virtual Machine (Relay VM) is the new generation of runtime to strike a balance between performance and flexibility when deploying and executing Relay programs. Previously, the graph runtime is able to utilize the fully static nature of the input graphs to perform aggressive optimization such as fully static allocation, and optimal memory reuse. When we introduce models which make use of control-flow, recursion, dynamic shapes, dynamic allocation we must change how execution works.

Relay VM is now usable and is able to achieve decent performance for a various of models and targets.

* Design (#2810 #2915) and a first version of implementation (#2889),
* Add VM runtime for Relay and compiler support (#3120, #3121, #2889, #3139)
* Relay VM (pattern matching #3470, port to python #3391, serialization #3647)
* Relay VM Profiler (#3727)

* [Relay][VM][Interpreter] Enable first-class constructors in VM and interpreter via eta expansion. (#4218)
* [Relay][VM] Clean up the VM and VM profiler code (#4391)

### Training
Relay is designed to natively support first-order and higher-order differentiation. The automatic differentiation infrastructure is now usable and a count of operators with gradient support are available in v0.6 release.

* Higher order reverse mode automatic differentiation that work with control flow (#2496)
* Higher order continuation passing style (#3456, #3485 )

* [Relay][Training] Add and fix gradients (#4126)

### Quantization

Low-bit inference is getting more and more popular as it benefits both the performance and storage usage. TVM now supports two types of quantization. 1. Automatic quantizaion takes floating-point precision model, does per-layer calibration and generates low-bit model. 2. TVM also imports pre-quantized model from Tensorflow and MXNet, a new dialect QNN is introduced to handle further lowering to normal operators.

### Accelerator and Microcontroller Support

TSIM is introduced to improve software and hardware integration and simulation accuracy. It integrates the hardware development process into the software stack. TSIM enables VTA to provide a more accurate performance feedback, i.e. clock cycles, compared to the traditional functional model of a hardware accelerator. Moreover, Chisel implementation for VTA is availale and it runs on top of TSIM.

There has been a proliferation of resource-constrained and embedded devices that do not have operating systems or a mature software stack. MicroTVM is intended to support TVM on such bare-metal devices.

### Known Issues

* The performance of Relay VM is not good enough on GPU, due to memeory allocation overhead which will be resolved later.
* TFlite rounding vs tvm rounding causing differences in accuracy and potentially off by 1 errors. For reference #3900
* TFlite pre-quantized network support is still a work in progress and the project would welcome further contributions.
* TSIM build requires `python` command exist on the host. See [forum discussion](https://discuss.tvm.ai/t/vta-build-failure/4790) for details.
* Tensorflow control flow has not been fully supported in the frontend converter.
* `topi.floor_div` is inconsistent with floor division semantic when result number is close to an integer.


### Depreciations
* Deprecating python2 support and following release (v0.6). (#2994, #2986)
* NNVM is deprecated and will be removed in a future version. (#4333, #4368)
