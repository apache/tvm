# TVM wheel packaging

The wheels are built by a standard `cibuildwheel` flow, configured in
`.github/workflows/publish_wheel.yml` and `pyproject.toml` (`[tool.cibuildwheel]`
and `[tool.scikit-build]`). This directory holds the few helper scripts that flow
invokes:

- `manylinux_build_libtvm_runtime_cuda.sh` — run by the `build_cuda_runtime` CI
  stage; builds the `libtvm_runtime_cuda.so` sidecar inside the manylinux container.
- `windows_build_libtvm_runtime_cuda.bat` — the Windows equivalent (run with
  `shell: cmd`), building `tvm_runtime_cuda.dll`.
- `build-environment.yaml` — conda environment for building the wheel.
