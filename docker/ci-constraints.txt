# This file lists packages we intentionally hold back in CI for no reason other than that
# updates outside of these bounds require a considerable amount of work, and allowing them to float
# freely would mean that small changes to the TVM dependency set could be held up behind large
# migration tasks if a new version of these packages were to be released. Holding packages back
# here allows us to decide when to tackle such migration work.
