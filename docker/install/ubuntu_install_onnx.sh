# We need to fix the onnx version because changing versions tends to break tests
# TODO(mbrookhart): periodically update

# onnx 1.9 removed onnx optimizer from the main repo (see
# https://github.com/onnx/onnx/pull/2834).  When updating the CI image
# to onnx>=1.9, onnxoptimizer should also be installed.
pip3 install \
    onnx==1.10.2 \
    onnxruntime==1.9.0 \
    onnxoptimizer==0.2.6
    
# torch depends on a number of other packages, but unhelpfully, does
# not expose that in the wheel!!!
