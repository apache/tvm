    r"""Requantized operator.

    The requantize operator converts one quantized tensor representation to
    another quantized tensor representation. For the output tensor, we are
    provided with output scale and zero point. The computation is as follows

    Q_output = zp_output +  (scale_input)/(scale_ouptut) * (Q_input - zp_input)

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : tvm.relay.Expr
        The input data to the operator.

    input_scale: float
           The quantization scale for the input tensor.

    input_zero_point: int
           The zero point of the input tensor.

    output_scale: float
           The quantization scale for the output tensor.

    output_zero_point: int
           The zero point of the output tensor.

    rounding : string, optional
        Defines the rounding direction when the value is midway between two
        representable values.

    out_dtype : str, optional
        Specifies the output data type for mixed precision conv2d.

    Returns
    -------
    result : tvm.relay.Expr
        The computed result.
