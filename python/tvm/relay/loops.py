    Construct a while loop.

    Parameters
    ----------

    cond: Callable[Tuple[relay.Expr], relay.Expr]
        The condition of the loop.

    loop_vars:  Tuple[relay.Expr]
        The variables being looped over.
        The initial values of the loop, will be used to
        construct the loop variables.

    loop_bodies: Callable[Tuple[relay.Expr], Tuple[relay.Expr]]
        The body of the loop, should be a function which
        given loop variables produces the output result
        also as a tuple

    Returns
    -------
    loop: relay.Expr
        The loop expression.
