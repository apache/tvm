    r"""2D convolution.

    This operator takes the weight as the convolution kernel
    and convolves it with data to produce an output.


    In the default case, where the data_layout is `NCHW`
    and weight_layout is `OIHW`, conv2d takes in
    a data Tensor with shape `(batch_size, in_channels, height, width)`,
    and a weight Tensor with shape `(channels, in_channels, kernel_size[0], kernel_size[1])`
    to produce an output Tensor with the following rule:

    .. math::

        \mbox{out}[b, c, y, x] = \sum_{dy, dx, k}
           \mbox{data}[b, k, \mbox{strides}[0] * y  + dy, \mbox{strides}[1] * x + dx] *
           \mbox{weight}[c, k, dy, dx]

    Padding and dilation are applied to data and weight respectively before the computation.
    This operator accepts data layout specification.
    Semantically, the operator will convert the layout to the canonical layout
    (`NCHW` for data and `OIHW` for weight), perform the computation,
    then convert to the out_layout.


    Parameters
    ----------
    data : relay.Expr
        The input data to the operator.

    weight : relay.Expr
        The weight expressions.

    strides : tuple of int, optional
        The strides of convoltution.

    padding : tuple of int, optional
        The padding of convolution on both sides of inputs before convolution.

    dilation : tuple of int, optional
        Specifies the dilation rate to be used for dilated convolution.

    groups : int, optional
        Number of groups for grouped convolution.

    channels : int, optional
        Number of output channels of this convolution.

    kernel_size : tuple of int, optional
        The spatial of the convolution kernel.

    data_layout : str, optional
        Layout of the input.

    weight_layout : str, optional
        Layout of the weight.

    out_layout : str, optional
        Layout of the output, by default, out_layout is the same as data_layout

    out_dtype : str, optional
        Specifies the output data type for mixed precision conv2d.

    Returns
    -------
    result : relay.Expr
        The computed result.
