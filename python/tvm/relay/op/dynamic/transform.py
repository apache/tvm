def reshape(data, newshape):
    """Reshape the input array based on the values of the newshape tensor.

    To give user more convenience in without doing manual shape inference,
    some dimensions of the shape can take special values from the set {0, -1, -3}.
    The significance of each is explained below:

    ``0`` copy this dimension from the input to the output shape.

        .. code-block:: python

            data.shape = (2,3,4), newshape = (4,0,2), result.shape = (4,3,2)
            data.shape = (2,3,4), newshape = (2,0,0), result.shape = (2,3,4)

    ``-1`` infers the dimension of the output shape by using the remainder of
    the input dimensions keeping the size of the new array same as that of the input array.
    At most one dimension of shape can be -1.

        .. code-block:: python

            data.shape = (2,3,4), newshape = (6,1,-1), result.shape = (6,1,4)
            data.shape = (2,3,4), newshape = (3,-1,8), result.shape = (3,1,8)
            data.shape = (2,3,4), newshape = (-1,), result.shape = (24,)

    ``-3`` use the product of two consecutive dimensions of the input shape
    as the output dimension.

        .. code-block:: python

            data.shape = (2,3,4), newshape = (-3,4), result.shape = (6,4)
            data.shape = (2,3,4,5), newshape = (-3,-3), result.shape = (6,20)
            data.shape = (2,3,4), newshape = (0,-3), result.shape = (2,12)
            data.shape = (2,3,4), newshape = (-3,-2), result.shape = (6,4)

    Special values -2 and -4 from the standard reshape op would introduce dynamic rank
    in this op. Thus, they are not permitted.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : relay.Expr
        The input data to the operator.

    newshape : relay.Expr
        The new shape. Should be compatible with the original shape.

    Returns
    -------
    result : relay.Expr
        The reshaped result.
    """
    return _make.reshape(data, newshape)
