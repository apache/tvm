"""Hybrid Programming APIs of TVM Python Package.

This package maps a subset of python to HalideIR so that:
1. Users can write some preliminary versions of the computation patterns
have not been supported yet and verify it across the real execution and
python semantic emulation.
2. So far, it is a text format dedicated to HalideIR Phase 0. Refer tvm.lower
for more details. A larger ambition of this module is to support all levels of
HalideIR.
"""

# TODO(@were): Make this module more complete.
# 1. Support HalideIR dumping to Hybrid Script
# 2. Support multi-level HalideIR
