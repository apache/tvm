    Parameters
    ----------
    data : numpy.ndarray
        N-D with shape (d_0, d_1, ..., d_{N-1})

    weight: numpy.ndarray
        K-D with shape (r_0, r_1, ..., r_{K-1}) where K == len(axis) and d_{axis_k} == r_k

    bias: numpy.ndarray
        Optional, K-D with shape (r_0, r_1, ..., r_{K-1}) where K == len(axis) and d_{axis_k} == r_k

    axis : int or tuple of ints
        Axis over the normalization applied

    epsilon : float
        The epsilon value to avoid division by zero.

    Returns
    -------
    result : np.ndarray
        N-D with shape (d_0, d_1, ..., d_{N-1})
