        The second input tensor.

    Parameters
    ----------

    weight : relax.Expr
        The weight tensor.

    bias : Optional[Expr]
        The bias tensor.

        The data type of the matmul result.
        When it is not specified, the output dtype will be the the same as input dtype.

    Notes
    -----
    Relax does not regard the Linear Op as a primitive Op,
    while combine the transpose, matmul and add op to implement it.

    Returns
    -------
    result : relax.Expr
        The computed result.
