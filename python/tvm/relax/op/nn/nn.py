    r"""1D convolution.

    This operator takes the weight as the 1D convolution kernel
    and convolves it with data to produce an output.


    In the default case, where the data_layout is `NCW`
    and kernel_layout is `OIW`, conv1d takes in
    a data Tensor with shape `(batch_size, in_channels, width)`,
    and a weight Tensor with shape `(channels, in_channels, kernel_w)`,
    where `kernel_w` is the length of the `W` kernel dimension,
    to produce an output Tensor with the following rule:

    .. math::

        \mbox{out}[b, c, x] = \sum_{dx, k}
           \mbox{data}[b, k, \mbox{strides} * x + dx] *
           \mbox{weight}[c, k, dx]

    Padding and dilation are applied to data and weight respectively before the computation.
    This operator accepts data layout specification.
    Semantically, the operator will convert the layout to the canonical layout
    (`NCW` for data and `OIW` for weight), perform the computation,
    then convert to the out_layout.

    This operator is intended to be the gradient operator of conv2d. That means, if

    `out = conv2d(data, weight, strides, padding, dilation)`,

    `data_grad = conv2d_transpose(out_grad, weight, strides, padding, output_padding, dilation)`,

    where `output_padding` is a parameter used to determine the output shape.

    The output shape can be explained in the simple case when `data_layout == "NCHW"` and
    `kernel_layout == "IOHW"`. Suppose `data` has shape `(N, in_channel, in_h, in_w)`, `weight` has
    shape `(in_channel, out_channel, weight_h, weight_w)`, we need to assure that
    `in_channel % groups == 0`. The shape of the output will be
    `(N, out_channel * groups, out_h, out_w)`, where

        out[:,i,:,...] = \frac{data[:,i,:,...] - data\_mean[i]}{\sqrt{data\_var[i]+\epsilon}}
            * gamma[i] + beta[i]

    Both *mean* and *var* returns a scalar by treating the input as a vector.

    Assume the input has size *k* on axis 1, then both ``gamma`` and ``beta``
    have shape *(k,)*.

    Besides the inputs and the outputs, this operator accepts two auxiliary
    states, ``moving_mean`` and ``moving_var``, which are *k*-length
    vectors. They are global statistics for the whole dataset, which are updated by

    .. code:: python

        moving_mean = moving_mean * momentum + data_mean * (1 - momentum)
        moving_var = moving_var * momentum + data_var * (1 - momentum)

    The parameter ``axis`` specifies which axis of the input shape denotes
    the 'channel' (separately normalized groups).  The default is 1.
    Specifying -1 sets the channel axis to be the last item in the input shape.

    .. note::

        This operator can be optimized away for inference.

        Running mean of input.

    moving_var : relax.Expr
        Running variance of input.

    axis : int
        The axis along which the normalization is applied.

    epsilon : float
        Small float added to variance to avoid dividing by zero.

    center : bool
        Indicating if the beta offset will be added to the normalized tensor.

    Layer normalization (Lei Ba and et al., 2016).
    Applies layer normalization to the n-dimensional input array.
    This operator takes an n-dimensional input array and normalizes
    the input using the given axis:

    .. math::

        out = \frac{data - mean(data, axis)}{\sqrt{var(data, axis)+\epsilon}}
            * gamma + beta

    Unlike batch normalization, the mean and var are computed along the channel dimension.

    Assume the input has size k on axis 1, then both gamma and beta have shape (k,).

    .. note::

        This operator can be optimized away for inference.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : relax.Expr
        Input to which layer_norm will be applied.

    gamma : relax.Expr
        The gamma scale factor.

    beta : relax.Expr
