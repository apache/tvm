    Parameters
    ----------
    x : relax.Expr
        The source tensor.

    indices : relax.Expr
        The indices of the values to extract.

    axis : Optional[int]
        The axis over which to select values.
        If it is none, the input tensor is required to be one-dimensional.

    mode : str
        Specifies how out-of-bounds indices will behave.
        - fast (default): extra indices lead to seg fault (user must make sure indices are in-bound)
        - nan: produce NaNs for out-of-bounds indices
        - wrap: wrap around the indices
        - clip: clip to the range

    -------
    ret : relax.Expr
        The taken result.
