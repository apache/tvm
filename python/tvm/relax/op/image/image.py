    """Image resize2d operator.

    This operator takes data as input and does 2D scaling to the given scale factor.
    In the default case, where the data_layout is `NCHW`
    with data of shape (n, c, h, w)
    out will have a shape (n, c, size[0], size[1])

    method indicates the algorithm to be used while calculating the out value
    and method can be one of ("linear", "nearest_neighbor", "cubic")

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : relax.Expr
        The input data to the operator.

    size: Union[Expr, PrimExprLike, Tuple[PrimExprLike]]
        The out size to which the image will be resized.
        If specified as a list, it is required to have length either 1 or 2.
        If specified as an Expr, it is required to have ndim 2.

    roi: Optional[Union[float, Tuple[float]]]
        The region of interest for cropping the input image. Expected to be of
        size 4, and format [start_h, start_w, end_h, end_w].
        Only used if coordinate_transformation_mode is tf_crop_and_resize.

    layout : str
        Layout of the input.

    method : str
        Scale method to used [nearest_neighbor, linear, cubic].

    coordinate_transformation_mode : str
        Describes how to transform the coordinate in the resized tensor
        to the coordinate in the original tensor. Definitions can be found
        in topi/image/resize.py.
        [half_pixel, align_corners, asymmetric, pytorch_half_pixel,
        tf_half_pixel_for_nn, and tf_crop_and_resize].

    rounding_method: str
        indicates how to find the "nearest" pixel in nearest_neighbor method
        [round, floor, ceil]

    cubic_alpha: float
        Spline Coefficient for bicubic interpolation

    cubic_exclude: int
        Flag to exclude exterior of the image during bicubic interpolation

    extrapolation_value: float
        Fill value to use when roi is outside of the image

    out_dtype : Optional[Union[str, DataType]]
        The dtype of the output tensor.
        It it is not specified, the output will have the same dtype as input if not specified.

    Returns
    -------
    result: relax.Expr
        The resized result.
