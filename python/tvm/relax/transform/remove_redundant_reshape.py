    A literal ``0`` in a reshape target means "copy the corresponding input dimension",
    and ``relax.op.reshape`` resolves it against the input it is handed. Moving such a
    target onto a different input therefore changes what it asks for. For
    ``x: (0, 3, 5)``, ``reshape(reshape(x, [0, 0, 5]), [0, 0, 0])`` is ``(0, 0, 0)``,
    while the combined ``reshape(x, [0, 0, 0])`` copies all three dimensions back and is
    ``(0, 3, 5)``.

    Rather than reason about which zeros are safe, re-resolve the target against the new
    input and keep the rewrite only when it comes back unchanged.
