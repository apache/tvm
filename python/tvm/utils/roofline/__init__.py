    :py:func:`roofline_analysis` should always be used instead of this function
    unless you need a custom compilation pipeline.

    Calculating roofline statistics requires features extracted the TIR
    functions in addition to per-operator runtime information (`report`) of the
    same TIR features. The features and TIR functions are not included with the
    compiled library used to generate the per-operator runtime. It is essential
    that the per-operator information comes from the exact same compilation
    pipeline as the TIR functions.


    Example
    -------

    ..code: : python

        import tvm
        import tvm.relay

    Parameters
    ----------
    report : Report
        Existing profiling report from :py:method:`VirtualMachineProfiler.profile`.
    tir_functions : Dict[GlobalVar, PrimFunc]
        TIR primfuncs from the module run to generate `report`. It is nessesary
        that these functions come before the `tir.MakePackedAPI` pass and are
        compatible with auto_scheduler featurization.
        :py:class:`SaveLoweredTIR` is the recommended way to collect these
        functions.
    target : Target
        TVM target that `report` was generated with.
    dev : Device
        Device that `report` was generated with.
    remote : Optional[RPCSession]
      Remote session used to upload artifacts for runtime evaluation. Must be
      the same session used to create `dev`.

    Returns
    -------
    profiling.Report
        New profiling report that includes all information from `report`
        along with additional roofline metrics. See
        :py:func:`roofline_analysis` for more information on which metrics
        are included.

    """
    Create a profiling report that contains roofline and other estimated
    statistics from running a module on the VM.

    The roofline model measures how close a operator gets to best possible
    memory bandwidth or FLOP/s depending on whether it is memory or compute
    bound. This computation uses the runtime of the operator along with two
    numbers extracted from the TIR code: bytes of memory touched and number of
    floating point operations.

    These statistics are calculated by analyzing the lowered TIR of each
    operator, so they are estimates of the true values. The statistics are:
      - Bound: Is the operator memory or compute bound. This is computed by
        assuming that the operator could perfectly cache all loads -- each byte
        of memory is only loaded once.
      - Percent of Theoretical Optimal: What percent of theoretical optimal for
        the bound. i.e. percent of peak memory bandwidth if memory bound,
        percent of peak FLOP/s if compute bound.
      - Loaded Bytes: estimation of the number of bytes loaded from main memory.
      - Estimated Flops: estimated number of floating point operations.
      - Arithmetic Intensity: ratio of FLOPs per byte of data.
      - FLOP/s: floating point operations per second.
      - Bandwidth: Number of bytes loaded per second.
