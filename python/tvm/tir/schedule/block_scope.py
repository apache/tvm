    - Loop sref: An StmtSRef that points to a TensorIR for loop.
    - Parent sref: The parent sref of an sref is the block/loop sref that points to its closest
    schedulable statement of its ancestors on the TensorIR AST.
    - Root sref: Sref to the root block. Every sref has exactly one parent sref
    except for root sref.
    - Sref tree: The parent-children-relationship of srefs that forms a tree,
    uniquely determined by the TensorIR AST.
