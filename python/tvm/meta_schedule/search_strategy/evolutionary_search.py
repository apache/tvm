    Replay Trace Search Strategy is a search strategy that always replays the trace by removing its

    Parameters
    ----------
    num_trials_per_iter : int
        Number of trials per iteration.
    num_trials_total : int
        Total number of trials.
    population_size : int
        The initial population of traces from measured samples and randomly generated samples.
    init_measured_ratio : int
        The ratio of measured samples in the initial population.
    init_min_unmeasured : int
        The minimal size of unmeasured population in the initial sampling.
    genetic_num_iters : int
        The number of iterations for genetic algorithm.
    genetic_mutate_prob : float
        The probability of mutation.
    genetic_max_fail_count : int
        The maximum number to retry mutation.
    eps_greedy : float
        The ratio of greedy selected samples in the final picks.
