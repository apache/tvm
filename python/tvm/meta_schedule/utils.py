    ----
    The meta schedule search infra intentionally does not adopt the following convention in TVM:
    - C++ API `tvm::runtime::threading::MaxConcurrency()`
    - Environment variable `TVM_NUM_THREADS` or
    - Environment variable `OMP_NUM_THREADS`

    This is because these variables are dedicated to controlling
    the runtime behavior of generated kernels, instead of the host-side search.
    Setting these variables may interfere the host-side search with profiling of generated kernels
    when measuring locally.
