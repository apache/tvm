    Parameters
    ----------
    low : int
        Lowest (signed) integer to be drawn from the distribution
    high : int
        One above the largest (signed) integer to be drawn from the distribution

    Samples are uniformly distributed over the half-open interval [low, high)

    Parameters
    ----------
    low : float
        Lower boundary of the output interval. All values generated will be
        greater than or equal to low.
    high : float
        Upper boundary of the output interval. All values generated will be
        less than high.
    size : tuple of ints
        Output shape. If the given shape is, e.g., (m, n, k), then m * n * k
