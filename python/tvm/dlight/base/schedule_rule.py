    Given a PrimFunc, a target, and a tunable flag, the apply method of a ScheduleRule
    returns either a Schedule, a list of Schedules, or None, where None means that the rule
    is not applicable to the given PrimFunc. If the tunable flag is True, the ScheduleRule is
    allowed to return either a Schedule or a list of Schedules, and the Schedules are allowed to
    contain tunable instructions. If the tunable flag is False, the ScheduleRule is only allowed to
    return a Schedule, and the Schedule is not allowed to contain tunable instructions.
