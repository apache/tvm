Depending on your needs and your working environment, there are a few different
methods for installing TVM. These include:
    * Installing from the TLCPack Conda and Pip Packages
    * Installing from source

# Installing from TLC Pack
# ------------------------
# TVM is packaged and distributed as part of the volunteer TLCPack community.
# TLCPack is not affiliated with the Apache Software Foundation, and software
# distributed by them may include non-free hardware drivers. You can lean more
# about TLCPack at their `website <https://tlcpack.ai>`_. TLCPack offers a
# support matrix with instructions for how to install TVM on different
# platforms, with different features. If installing with pip or conda through
# TLCPack, we recommend to use one of the nightly builds, as they contain the
# latest version of `tvmc`. Some platforms and configurations are not
# available.  If your environment isn't supported, you can install TVM from
# source.

################################################################################
# Installing from Source
# ----------------------
# If you need to enable custom features for TVM, want to active contribute to
# development or are on a platform that isn't supported by TLCPack, you can
# install TVM from source.  The full instructions are on the `Install TVM From
# Source </install/from_source.html>`_ page.
