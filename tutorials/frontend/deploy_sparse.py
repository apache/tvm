Deploy a Hugging Face Pruned Model on CPU
=========================================
**Author**: `Josh Fromm <https://github.com/jwfromm>`_

This tutorial demonstrates how to take any pruned model, in this case `PruneBert
from Hugging Face
<https://huggingface.co/huggingface/prunebert-base-uncased-6-finepruned-w-distil-squad>`_,
and use TVM to leverage the model's sparsity support to produce real speedups. Although
the primary purpose of this tutorial is to realize speedups on already pruned
models, it may also be useful to estimate how fast a model would be *if* it were
pruned. To this end, we also provide a function that takes an unpruned model and
replaces its weights
with random and pruned weights at a specified sparsity. This may be a useful
feature when trying to decide if a model is worth pruning or not.

Before we get into the code, it's useful to discuss sparsity and pruning
and dig into the two
different types of sparsity: **structured** and **unstructured**.

Pruning is a technique primarily used to reduce the parameter size of a model
by replacing weight values with 0s. Although many methods exist for choosing which
weights should be set to 0, the most straight forward is by picking the 
weights with the smallest value. Typically, weights are pruned to a desired
sparsity percentage. For example, a 95% sparse model would have only 5% of
its weights non-zero. Pruning to very high sparsities often requires
finetuning or full retraining as it tends to be a lossy approximation.
Although parameter size benefits are quite easy to obtain from a pruned model
through simple compression, leveraging sparsity to yield runtime speedups
is more complicated.

In structured sparsity weights are pruned with the goal of clustering
pruned weights together. In other words, they are pruned using both their
value and location. The benefit of bunching up pruned weights is that it allows
an algorithm such as matrix multiplication to skip entire blocks. It turns out
that some degree of *block sparsity* is very important to realizing significant
speedups on most hardware available today. 
This is because when loading memory in most CPUs or GPUs, 
it doesn't save any work to skip reading a single value at a time, instead an entire
chunk or tile is read in and executed using something like vectorized instructions.

Unstructured sparse weights are those that are pruned only on the value of
the original weights. They may appear to be scattered randomly throughout
a tensor rather than in chunks like we'd see in block sparse weights.
At low sparsities, unstructured pruning techniques are difficult to
accelerate. However, at high sparsities many blocks of all 0 values
will naturally appear, making it possible to accelerate.

This tutorial interacts with both structured and unstructured sparsity.
Hugging Face's PruneBert model is unstructured but 95% sparse, allowing us
to apply TVM's block sparse optimizations to it, even if not optimally.
When generating random sparse weights for an unpruned model, we do so with structured
sparsity. A fun exercise is comparing the real speed of PruneBert with the block
sparse speed using fake weights to see the benefit of structured sparsity.

# Run the Sparse Graph
# --------------------
# Next we'll convert the graph into a sparse representation and generate
# fake sparse weights if needed. Then we'll use the same benchmarking
# script as dense to see how much faster we go! We apply a few relay passes
# to the graph to get it leveraging sparsity. First we use
# `simplify_fc_transpose` to use transposes on the weights of dense layers
# into the parameters. This makes it easier to convert to matrix multiplies
# to sparse versions. Next we apply `bsr_dense.convert` to identify all
# weight matrices that can be sparse, and automatically replace them.
#
# The `bsr_dense.convert` call below is doing the heavy lifting of identifying
# which weights in the model can be made sparse by checking if they are
# at least `sparsity_threshold` percent sparse. If so, it converts those
# weights into *Block Compressed Row Format (BSR)*. BSR is essentially
# a representation that indexes into the nonzero chunks of the tensor,
# making it easy for an algorithm to load those non-zero chunks and ignore
# the rest of the tensor. Once the sparse weights are in BSR format,
# `relay.transform.DenseToSparse` is applied to actually replace
# `relay.dense` operations with `relay.sparse_dense` calls that can be
# run faster.
