Auto-scheduling a Neural Network for NVIDIA GPU
===============================================
**Author**: `Lianmin Zheng <https://github.com/merrymercy>`_

Auto-tuning for specific devices and workloads is critical for getting the
best performance. This is a tutorial on how to tune a whole neural
network for NVIDIA GPU with the auto-scheduler.

To auto-tune a neural network, we partition the network into small subgraphs and 
tune them independently. Each subgraph is treated as one search task.
A task scheduler slices the time and dynamically allocates time resources to
these tasks. The task scheduler predicts the impact of each task on the end-to-end
execution time and prioritizes the one that can reduce the execution time the most.

For each subgraph, we use the compute declaration in :code:`tvm/python/topi` to
get the computational DAG in the tensor expression form.
We then use the auto-scheduler to construct a search space of this DAG and search
for good schedules (low-level optimizations).

Different from the template-based :ref:`autotvm <tutorials-autotvm-sec>` which relies on
manual templates to define the search space, the auto-scheduler does not require any
schedule templates. In other words, the auto-scheduler only uses the compute declarations
in :code:`tvm/python/topi` and does not use existing schedule templates.

Note that this tutorial will not run on Windows or recent versions of macOS. To
get it to run, you will need to wrap the body of this tutorial in a :code:`if
__name__ == "__main__":` block.

# Define a Network
# ----------------
# First, we need to define the network with relay frontend API.
# We can load some pre-defined network from :code:`tvm.relay.testing`.
# We can also load models from MXNet, ONNX, PyTorch, and TensorFlow
# (see :ref:`front end tutorials<tutorial-frontend>`).
#
# For convolutional neural networks, although auto-scheduler can work correctly
# with any layout, we found the best performance is typically achieved with NHWC layout.
# We also implemented more optimizations for NHWC layout with the auto-scheduler.
# So it is recommended to convert your models to NHWC layout to use the auto-scheduler.
# You can use :ref:`ConvertLayout <convert-layout-usage>` pass to do the layout conversion in TVM.

# as :code:`sum(latency[t] * weight[t])`, where :code:`latency[t]` is the
# latency of a task and :code:`weight[t]` is the weight of the task.
# The task scheduler will just optimize this objective.

#################################################################
# Begin Tuning
# ------------
# Now, we set some options for tuning and launch the search tasks
#
# * :code:`measure_ctx` launches a different process for measurement to
#   provide isolation. It can protect the master process from GPU crashes
#   during measurement and avoid other runtime conflicts.
# * :code:`min_repeat_ms` defines the minimum duration of one "repeat" in every measurement.
#   This can warmup the GPU, which is necessary to get accurate measurement results.
#   Typically, we recommend a value >= 300 ms.
# * :code:`num_measure_trials` is the number of measurement trials we can use during the tuning.
#   You can set it to a small number (e.g., 200) for a fast demonstrative run.
#   In practice, we recommend setting it around :code:`900 * len(tasks)`,
#   which is typically enough for the search to converge.
#   For example, there are 24 tasks in resnet-18, so we can set it as 20000.
#   You can adjust this parameter according to your time budget.
# * In addition, we use :code:`RecordToFile` to dump measurement records into a log file,
#   The measurement records can be used to query the history best, resume the search,
#   and do more analyses later.
# * see :any:`auto_scheduler.TuningOptions`,
#   :any:`auto_scheduler.LocalRPCMeasureContext` for more parameters.

#
#   This table lists the latency and (estimated) speed of all tasks.
#   It also lists the allocation of measurement trials for all tasks.
#   The last line prints the total weighted latency of these tasks,
#   which can be a rough estimation of the end-to-end execution time
#   of the network.
#   The last line also prints the total number of measurement trials,
#   total time spent on auto-tuning and the id of the next task to tune.
#
#   There will also be some "tvm::Error"s and CUDA errors, because the
#   auto-scheduler will try some invalid schedules.
#   You can safely ignore them if the tuning can continue, because these
#   errors are isolated from the main process.

######################################################################
# .. note:: Terminate the tuning earlier
#
#   You can terminate the tuning earlier by forcibly killing this process.
#   As long as you get at least one valid schedule for each task in the log file,
#   you should be able to do the compilation (the secion below).

#################################################################
# Compile and Evaluate
# --------------------
# After auto-tuning, we can compile the network with the best schedules we found.
# All measurement records are dumped into the log file during auto-tuning,
# so we can read the log file and load the best schedules.

# Compile with the history best

#################################################################
# Other Tips
# ----------
# 1. During the tuning, the auto-scheduler needs to compile many programs and
#    extract feature from them. This part is CPU-intensive,
#    so a high-performance CPU with many cores is recommended for faster search.
# 2. You can use :code:`python3 -m tvm.auto_scheduler.measure_record --mode distill -i log.json`
#    to distill the large log file and only save the best useful records.
# 3. You can resume a search from the previous log file. You just need to
#    add a new argument :code:`load_log_file` when creating the task scheduler
#    in function :code:`run_tuning`. Say,
#    :code:`tuner = auto_scheduler.TaskScheduler(tasks, task_weights, load_log_file=log_file)`
# 4. If you have multiple target GPUs, you can use all of them for measurements to
#    parallelize the measurements. Check this :ref:`section <tutorials-autotvm-scale-up-rpc-tracker>`
#    to learn how to use the RPC Tracker and RPC Server.
#    To use the RPC Tracker in auto-scheduler, replace the runner in :code:`TuningOptions`
#    with :any:`auto_scheduler.RPCRunner`.
