# HexagonLauncher
HexagonLauncher is a class to handle interactions with an Android phone which includes Hexagon DSP to run a TVMModule(function/operation/graph) on Hexagon. HexagonLauncher reuses minRPC implementation to setup an RPC connection from host (your local machine) to Hexagon target which is passed through Android RPC server.

## Build Required Tools/Libraries
To build TVM for Hexagon and run tests you can follow these steps to prepare a runtime on a Hexagon device to test any model. Alternatively, you can skip these instructions and use docker image which has pre-installed required tools. Instructions for using docker image [here](#use-hexagon-docker-image).

- Build TVMRuntime library and C++ RPC server for Android.
- Build minRPC server along with FastRPC for Hexagon.
- Build TVM library with Hexagon support for host machine.
- Build TVMRuntime library and RPC server for host machine.

Note: First, ensure to export Clang libraries to `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` and Hexagon toolchain to `HEXAGON_TOOLCHAIN`:

```bash
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:"path to `llvm-clang/lib` sub-directory"

export HEXAGON_TOOLCHAIN="Path to Hexagon toolchain. It can be the Hexagon toolchain included in the SDK, for example `HEXAGON_SDK_PATH/tools/HEXAGON_Tools/x.y.z/Tools`.  The `x.y.z` in the path is the toolchain version number, which is specific to the version of the SDK."
```

To build these pieces, first build Hexagon API application under `apps/hexagon_api`.

```bash
cd apps/hexagon_api
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DUSE_ANDROID_TOOLCHAIN="path to `android-ndk/build/cmake/android.toolchain.cmake` file" \
        -DANDROID_PLATFORM=android-28 \
        -DANDROID_ABI=arm64-v8a \
        -DUSE_HEXAGON_ARCH=v65|v66|v68 \
        -DUSE_HEXAGON_SDK="path to Hexagon SDK" \
        -DUSE_HEXAGON_TOOLCHAIN="path to Hexagon toolchain `Tools` sub-directory which explained above" \
        -DUSE_OUTPUT_BINARY_DIR="path to `build/hexagon_api_output` which is a sub-directory of `tvm`" ..
```

This command generates `tvm_rpc_android` and `libtvm_runtime.so` to run on Android. Also, it generates `libtvm_runtime.a` and `libhexagon_rpc_skel.so` to run on Hexagon device. Now we have TVM artifacts which are used to run on the remote device.

Next, we need to build TVM on host with RPC and Hexagon dependencies. To do that follow these commands.

```bash
cd tvm
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DUSE_LLVM="path to `llvm/bin/llvm-config`" \
        -DUSE_RPC=ON \
        -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER="path to `clang++` executable" \
        -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS='-stdlib=libc++' \
        -DUSE_HEXAGON_SDK="path to Hexagon SDK" \
        -DUSE_HEXAGON_ARCH="choose from v65|v66|v68" \
        -DUSE_HEXAGON_DEVICE=sim ..
```

## Use Hexagon Docker Image
To use this docker image, install TVM and tools follow these steps.

```bash
# Log in to docker image
cd tvm
./docker/bash.sh tlcpack/ci-hexagon:v0.01

# Build TVM
./tests/scripts/task_config_build_hexagon.sh 
cd build
cmake ..
make -j2

# Build Hexagon API
cd ..
./tests/scripts/task_build_hexagon_api.sh 
```

## Testing Using HexagonLauncher
Before starting a test you need to run an RPC tracker on your local machine and export HOST and PORT as environment variables. Also, you need to export Clang libraries to `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` and Hexagon toolchain to `HEXAGON_TOOLCHAIN` as explained above.

```bash
export TVM_TRACKER_HOST="0.0.0.0"
export TVM_TRACKER_PORT=9192
python -m tvm.exec.rpc_tracker --host $TVM_TRACKER_HOST --port $TVM_TRACKER_PORT
```

Now, follow these steps to create an RPC session from host to Hexagon.

```python
# create an HexagonLauncher instance
launcher = HexagonLauncher(serial_number="Serial number taken from `adb devices` command")

# Create a workspace directory for this test on Android.
# Upload required Android artifacts including TVMRuntime library and RPC server to Android workspace.
# Uses port `forward` and `reverse` to open connection on certain ports that TVM uses to connect to RPC tracker.
# Execute `android_bash.sh` on Android which creates two RPC servers and connects them to RPC tracker running on host machine. 
launcher.android_run_rpc(rpc_tracker_host="TVM_TRACKER_HOST", rpc_tracker_port="TVM_TRACKER_PORT")

# Upload Hexagon RPC libraries to Android workspace.
launcher.hexagon_setup()

# Create an RPC session from host to Hexagon.
remote_kw = {
    "host": "TVM_TRACKER_HOST",
    "port": "TVM_TRACKER_PORT",
    "priority": 0,
    "timeout": 60,
}
launcher.hexagon_session_setup(remote_kw)

# Upload TVMModule binary file to Android remote.
launcher.upload("Path to DSO binary file on host", "DSO filename on Android remote")
```

- To execute a single function/operator on Hexagon, follow these steps.
    ```python
    # Enter session.
    with launcher.session as sess:
        # dlopen DSO binary file on Hexagon.
        mod = launcher.get_module(dso_binary)
        # Use mod to run function/operator on Hexagon...
    ```
- Or, follow these steps to create a GraphExecutor and run a JSON graph.
    ```python
    graph_mod = launcher.get_local_graph_executor(lowered, dso_binary)
    graph_mod.set_input(...)
    graph_mod.run(...)
    ```
