"""Vitis-AI runtime test for CPU only part

This test verifies as much as possible whether the a model can be correctly offloaded
and executed for Vitis-AI acceleration. This entails:
    - Annotating and partitioning model for Vitis-AI acceleration
    - Building a Vitis-AI PyXIR runtime module with on-the-fly quantization enabled
    - Run first iteration of on-the-fly quantization flow. This will always be run
      on CPU as the first N (parameter) will be used for collecting calibration data
      for quantization.

NOTE This is not a full end-to-end test as we need the full Vitis-AI docker environment
and access to an FPGA instance for that. This test verifies the Vitis-AI flow as much as
possible without requiring access to dedicated docker environment and/or hardware setup.
NOTE Quantization is not being tested (we need to be inside Vitis-AI docker environment
for that) buth the internal representation used for quantization is being generated and
functionally tested (CPU).
