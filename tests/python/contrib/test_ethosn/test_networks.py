    Parameters
    ----------

        The URL to the model.
    model_sub_path : str
        The name of the model file.
    input_dict : dict
        The input dict.
    compile_hash : str, set
        The compile hash(es) to check the compilation output against.
    output_count : int
        The expected number of outputs.
    host_ops : int
        The expected number of host operators.
    npu_partitions : int
        The expected number of Ethos-N partitions.
    run : bool
        Whether or not to try running the network. If hardware isn't
        available, the run will still take place but with a mocked
        inference function, so the results will be incorrect. This is
        therefore just to test the runtime flow is working rather than
        to check the correctness/accuracy.
