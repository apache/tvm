Relay Language Reference
========================

This document is a work in progress language reference describing
Relay, TVM's high level intermediate representation. The name is an
allusion to interneurons which are often referred to as intermediate,
or relay neurons.

We will continually iterate on this document as we evolve the new IR
and update accordingly.
