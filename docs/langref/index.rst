Introduction to Relay
---------------------

Relay is a functional, differentiable programming language
designed to be an expressive intermediate representation for machine
learning systems. Relay supports closures, control flow, and
recursion, allowing it to directly represent more complex models
than can computation graph-based IRs.
Relay also includes a form of dependent typing using *type relations*
in order to handle shape analysis for operators with complex
requirements on argument shapes.

Relay is extensible by design and makes it easy for machine learning
researchers and practitioners to develop new large-scale program
transformations and optimizations.

The below pages describe the grammar, type system, and operators in Relay, respectively.

Hybrid Script
-------------

The below page describes the TVM hybrid script front-end,
which uses software emulation to support some constructs not
officially supported in TVM.
