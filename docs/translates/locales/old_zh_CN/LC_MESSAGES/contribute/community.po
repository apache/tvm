"TVM adopts the Apache style model and governs by merit. We believe that it "
"is important to create an inclusive community where everyone can use, "
"contribute to, and influence the direction of the project. See "
"`CONTRIBUTORS.md <https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/main/CONTRIBUTORS.md>`_"
" for the current list of contributors."

"Everyone in the community is welcomed to send patches, documents, and "
"propose new directions to the project. The key guideline here is to enable "
"everyone in the community to get involved and participate the decision and "
"development.  When major changes are proposed, an RFC should be sent to "
"allow discussion by the community. We encourage public discussion, "
"archivable channels such as issues, discuss forum and mailing-list, so that "
"everyone in the community can participate and review the process later."

"Code reviews are one of the key ways to ensure the quality of the code. "
"High-quality code reviews prevent technical debt for long-term and are "
"crucial to the success of the project. A pull request needs to be reviewed "
"before it gets merged. A committer who has the expertise of the "
"corresponding area would moderate the pull request and the merge the code "
"when it is ready. The corresponding committer could request multiple "
"reviewers who are familiar with the area of the code. We encourage "
"contributors to request code reviews themselves and help review each other's"
" code -- remember everyone is volunteering their time to the community, "
"high-quality code review itself costs as much as the actual code "
"contribution, you could get your code quickly reviewed if you do others the "
"same favor."

"Committers are individuals who are granted the write access to the project. "
"A committer is usually responsible for a certain area or several areas of "
"the code where they oversee the code review process. The area of "
"contribution can take all forms, including code contributions and code "
"reviews, documents, education, and outreach. Committers are essential for a "
"high quality and healthy project. The community actively look for new "
"committers from contributors. Here is a list of useful traits that help the "
"community to recognize potential committers:"

"The Project Management Committee(PMC) consists group of active committers "

" 3 +1 votes, and no vetoes. Any veto must be accompanied by reasoning. PMCs "
"should serve the community by upholding the community practices and "
