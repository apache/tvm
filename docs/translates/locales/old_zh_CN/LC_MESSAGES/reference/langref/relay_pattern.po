"There are many places in TVM where we identify pure data-flow sub-graphs "

"Many of these passes today require a lots of boring boilerplate code in "
"order to implement as well as requiring users to think in terms of "
"visitors and AST matching. Many of these transformations can easily be "
"described in terms of graph rewrites. In order to build a rewriter or "

"Such a language is not just useful for building a rewriter but also "
