"Algebraic data types (ADTs) are a staple feature of functional "
"programming languages, particularly those derived from ML, because they "
"express data structures in a manner that is easy to reason about when "
"writing recursive computations. Because recursion is intended to be one "
"of the primary mechanisms of control flow in Relay, it is important that "
"Relay include ADTs in order to best express loops and other control flow "
"structures that must be implemented using recursion."

"ADTs can be understood as a generalized version of :code:`enum` and "
":code:`struct` types from C-like languages. Like a C :code:`struct:`, an "
"ADT instance is a container for fields of specified types, but the type "
"system allows for the same type to encode different possible groupings of"
" fields in a systematic manner, similar to C :code:`enum` types, which "
"are defined using a finite set of possible values named by the user."
msgstr ""

"Specifically, an ADT is defined as a named group of constructors, each of"
" which is a function that takes values of specified types as arguments "
"and returns an instance of the named ADT. An ADT instance simply contains"
" the values of the arguments passed to the constructor call used to "
"produce it."
msgstr ""

#: ../../_staging/reference/langref/relay_adt.rst:48
msgid ""
"An ADT value is opaque until it is *deconstructed*, allowing the "
"arguments to the constructor to be accessed again and used to compute new"
" values. Because a particular ADT can have multiple constructors with "
"different signatures, it is usually necessary to branch on the different "
"possible constructors, resulting in the *match* syntax for ADTs. Hence, "
"ADTs are sometimes called \"tagged unions\" because an ADT instance is "
"tagged by the name of the constructor used to produce it and can later be"
" inspected based on the tag."
msgstr ""

#: ../../_staging/reference/langref/relay_adt.rst:56
msgid ""
"Because each ADT has a finite set of constructors, it is straightforward "
"to determine whether a function processing an ADT instance is handling "
"all possible cases. In particular, the type system can ensure that types "
"are properly assigned in all cases when deconstructing an ADT instance, "
"in contrast to :code:`union` types in C. Hence, it is often easy to "
"reason about ADTs."

"*Implementation detail: Relay ADT definitions are global and are stored "
"in the module, similarly to global function definitions. An ADT name is, "

"variables) to the list of constructors for that ADT.*"

"This section will go into more specific detail about the typing of ADTs. "
"Most of the complexity involved results from the fact that, as with "
"functions, ADTs can be polymorphic and take type parameters."
msgstr ""

#: ../../_staging/reference/langref/relay_adt.rst:118

"For example, one of the standard ADTs commonly used in functional "
"programming languages is the optional type, defined here:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../_staging/reference/langref/relay_adt.rst:129
msgid ""
"Optional types are commonly used as the return type for any operation "
"involving querying into a data structure (returning :code:`Some(v)` if a "
"value is found and :code:`None` if it isn't). Taking a type parameter in "
"the definition allows the same optional type to be used in a wide variety"
" of situations, rather than having to define a unique ADT for each "
"different type that could be contained in it."
msgstr ""

#: ../../_staging/reference/langref/relay_adt.rst:136
msgid ""
"However, it is important to ensure that option types whose contents are "
"of different types can still be distinguished by the type system, since "
"it would violate type safety if a function expecting an option containing"
" a :code:`Tensor[(), int32]` instead receives an option containing a "
":code:`Tensor[(3, 4), float32]`. As this example may imply, an ADT "
"instance is thus given a type that contains the concrete type arguments "
"for that instance, ensuring the information is kept around. Let the below"
" example illustrate:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../_staging/reference/langref/relay_adt.rst:167
msgid ""
"The syntax for the annotated type arguments (e.g., "
":code:`Optional[Tensor[(), int32]]`) in the above examples is called a "
"\"type call,\" treating the polymorphic ADT definition as a type-level "
"function (taking type params and returning a type, namely the ADT). Any "
"ADT appearing in a type annotation or function signature must be "
"annotated with type arguments (a non-polymorphic ADT must be in a type "
"call with no arguments)."
msgstr ""

"Thus, we can say in general that if constructor :code:`C` that takes "
"arguments of types :code:`T1, ..., Tn` is a constructor for an ADT "
":code:`D` that takes type parameters :code:`v1, ..., vn` (where "
":code:`T1, ..., Tn` may contain any of the :code:`v1, ..., vn`), then "
":code:`C` has the type :code:`fun<v1, ..., vn>(T1, ..., Tn) -> D[v1, ...,"
" vn]`. This means that constructors are typed like ordinary functions and"
" thus appear inside call nodes and can be passed to or returned by other "
"functions. In particular, the :code:`Some` example above has the "
"signature :code:`fun<a>(a) -> Optional[a]`, while :code:`None` has the "
