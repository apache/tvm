"This article is an introductory tutorial of automatic quantization with "
"TVM. Automatic quantization is one of the quantization modes in TVM. More"
" details on the quantization story in TVM can be found `here "

"tutorial, we will import a GluonCV pre-trained model on ImageNet to "
"Relay, quantize the Relay model and then perform the inference."

"For weights, the scales are directly calculated based on the value of the"
" weights. Two modes are supported: `power2` and `max`. Both modes find "
"the maximum value within the weight tensor first. In `power2` mode, the "
"maximum is rounded down to power of two. If the scales of both weights "
"and intermediate feature maps are power of two, we can leverage bit "
"shifting for multiplications. This make it computationally more "
"efficient. In `max` mode, the maximum is used as the scale. Without "
"rounding, `max` mode might have better accuracy in some cases. When the "
"scales are not powers of two, fixed point multiplications will be used."

"For intermediate feature maps, we can find the scales with data-aware "
"quantization. Data-aware quantization takes a calibration dataset as the "
"input argument. Scales are calculated by minimizing the KL divergence "
"between distribution of activation before and after quantization. "
"Alternatively, we can also use pre-defined global scales. This saves the "
"time for calibration. But the accuracy might be impacted."
