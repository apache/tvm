"As the number of optimization passes increases in Relay/tir, it becomes "

"Therefore, we have introduced an infrastructure to manage the optimization "
"passes and make it applicable to different layers of the IR in the TVM "
"stack."

"Relay, hence, provides :py:class:`tvm.transform.Sequential` to alleviate "
"developers from handling these issues explicitly by specifying the required "
"passes of each pass and packing them as a whole to execute. For example, the"
" same passes can now be applied using the sequential style as the following."
" :py:class:`tvm.transform.Sequential` is similiar to `torch.nn.sequential "

"`mxnet.gluon.block "

"From the transformed Relay program, we can see that there are still two "
"identical addition operations. This is because ``EliminateCommonSubexpr`` "
"was not actually performed. The reason is because only the passes that have "
"optimization level less or equal to 2 will be executed by default under "
":py:class:`tvm.transform.Sequential`. The pass infra, however, provides a "
"configuration interface for users to customize the optimization level that "

"The next example illustrates how we can orchestrate a customized "

"functionality greatly eases the implementation of passes. For example, users"
" can simply define a decorated class to do function-level optimizations as "
"the following example shows. `transform_function` wraps a class to replace "
"all constants with a multiple of `c`. Later on, each function in a given "
"module will be visited and each constant in the function will be replaced "
