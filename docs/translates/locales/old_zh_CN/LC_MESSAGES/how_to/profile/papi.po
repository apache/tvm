"The Performance Application Programming Interface (PAPI) is a library "
"that provides performance counters on a variety of platforms. Performance"
" counters provide accurate low-level information about processors "
"behavior during a given execution run. This information can contain "
"simple metrics like total cycle count, cache misses, and instructions "
"executed as well as more high level information like total FLOPS and warp"
" occupancy. PAPI makes these metrics available while profiling."
