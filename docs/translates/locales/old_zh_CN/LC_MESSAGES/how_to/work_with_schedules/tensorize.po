"As showed in the IR printed above, the inner loops :code:`j.inner` along "

"Before scheduling the tensorization, we need to first define the "
"intrinsic function for GEMV. It includes two parts, the first is a "
"compute definition of GEMV. TVM uses it to match the computing pattern in"
" the original Matmul schedule. The second is to specify how to execute "
"GEMV on the device, which is done in :code:`intrin_func` below."

"Here :code:`te.decl_tensor_intrin` declares how to execute the "
"computation :code:`c.op`. Our implementation simply takes the inputs and "
"outputs, converts them to pointers and emit an external function call. "
"Note that tensorization requires user to specify :code:`offset_factor`, "
"with this information, TVM has knowledge of whether the data is aligned "
"between the start address of the original data structure and the offset "
"being passed to tensorize, so that it has chance to optimize with "
"vectorized loading. We set the factor to 1 for simplification."

"Buffers are also declared for inputs and outputs, though this is not "

"example, we pass :code:`bb.strides[0]` as an argument to the external "
"function :code:`gemv_update`. For now :code:`bb.strides[0] == l`, but "
"later we will see how they can differ with more complicated schedules."

"Note that we use :code:`te.var(\"s1\")` as the first stride dimension for"

"By tensorizing over :code:`yi`, the inner most two loops are now replaced"

"Assume our accelerator could only multiply a vector by a square matrix, "

#: ../../_staging/how_to/work_with_schedules/tensorize.rst:466

"However, since the tensorize intrinsic now only covers a part of the "
"reduce axis, instead of using one \"body\" function, TVM requires a "
":code:`reduce_reset` function, which will be invoked before the reduce "

"This tutorial demonstrates the usage of tensorize intrinsic in TVM. "
"Tensorize provides a way for users to get fully optimized schedule via "
"micro-kernels. For example, INT8 quantization on Intel CPUs uses "
"tensorization to invoke AVX instruction directly. It also enables TVM to "
"compile to ASICs - checkout :ref:`vta-index` for details. We also "
"demonstrates how to use inline assembly importing, which helps users "
"inject asm easily into the schedule."
