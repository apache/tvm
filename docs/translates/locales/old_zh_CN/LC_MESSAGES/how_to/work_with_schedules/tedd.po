"Now, let us take a close look at the second schedule tree.  Every block "
"under ROOT represents a stage.  Stage name shows in the top row and compute "
"shows in the bottom row. The middle rows are for IterVars, the higher the "
"outer, the lower the inner. An IterVar row contains its index, name, type, "
"and other optional information. Let's use the W.shared stage as an example."
"  The top row tells its name, \"W.shared\", and memory scope, \"Shared\".  "
"Its compute is :code:`W(ax0, ax1, ax2, ax3)`. Its outer most loop IterVar is"
" ax0.ax1.fused.ax2.fused.ax3.fused.outer, indexed with 0, of kDataPar, bound"
" to threadIdx.y, and with range(min=0, ext=8). You can also tell IterVar "
"type with the index box color, shown in the legend."

"If a stage doesn't compute_at any other stage, it has an edge directly to "

"The last one is an IterVar Relationship Graph.  Every subgraph represents a "

"W.shared has three split nodes and three fuse nodes.  The rest are IterVar "
"nodes of the same format as the IterVar rows in Schedule Trees.  Root "
"IterVars are those not driven by any transformation node, such as ax0; leaf "
"IterVars don't drive any transformation node and have non-negative indices, "
