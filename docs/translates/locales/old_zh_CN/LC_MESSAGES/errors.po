"This error is caused by an internal invariant being violated during TVM's "
"execution. On a technical level, the message is generated by the ``ICHECK`` "
"macro, found in ``include/tvm/runtime/logging.h``. The ``ICHECK`` macro is "
"used in many places in the TVM code to assert some condition is true during "
"execution; any time the assertion fails, TVM will exit with the error "
"message shown above."
