msgid ""
"Compiler passes are the primary interface for both extending Relay's "
"feature set and for performing optimizations on Relay programs. By "
"writing a compiler pass, you can modify the AST or collect information "
"about the AST, depending on your goal. Indeed, some of Relay's most "
"important built-in features (e.g., autodiff and type inference) are "
"nothing more than \"standard\" compiler passes."

"The base class used to traverse Relay programs is ``ExprFunctor``. The "
"public interface it provides is a ``VisitExpr`` method that takes an "
"expression and zero or more arguments and returns an instance of some "
"type. When you extend this class, you define the AST traversal pattern by"
" overriding implementations of ``VisitExpr_`` for each type of "
"expression."
msgstr ""

#: ../../_staging/dev/how_to/relay_add_pass.rst:48
msgid ""
"The relation between ``VisitExpr`` and ``VisitExpr_`` has to do with "
"dispatch. Each ``VisitExpr_`` definition targets a specific type of "
"expression, but you don't always know which node type you'll be visiting."
" To remedy this, ``ExprFunctor`` provides a ``VisitExpr`` function which "
"routes from the given expression to the ``VisitExpr_`` case that handles "
"it. Although C++ already provides dynamic dispatch, ``ExprFunctor`` "
"defines its own vtable, which ``VisitExpr`` uses. By defining our own "
"vtable, we have more control over dispatch. For example, if we wanted to "
"define a ``PrintVisitor`` traverser that printed \"Here\" before every "
"visit, we could override ``VisitExpr``:"

msgid ""
"``ExprFunctor`` itself is a very general class, which is why more often "
"than not, you will be extending ``ExprVisitor`` or ``ExprMutator``. These"
" classes extend ``ExprFunctor`` and provide default implementations of "
"``VisitExpr_`` that capture common traversal patterns for each expression"
" type. Having these default implementations means we only need to provide"
" overriding implementations for the expression types where we want "
"different behavior. We describe each subclass on its own in the following"

"``ExprVisitor`` is for passes that don't modify the program and instead "

"Now, if we wanted to write a class ``CallChecker`` that checks if any "

"And that's all we need. It is very common to define a public interface "

"One feature ``ExprMutator`` has that ``ExprVisitor`` doesn't is a built-"

"because we want to bypass the vtable (to avoid an infinite loop) and use "
"the default implementation provided by ``ExprMutator``. Then we evaluate "
"the call only if all of the arguments are constant (using "
