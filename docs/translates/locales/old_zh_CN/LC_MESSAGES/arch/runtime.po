"In the above codeblock, we defined a PackedFunc MyAdd. It takes two "
"arguments : ``args`` represents input arguments and ``rv`` represents return"
" value. The function is type-erased, which means that the function signature"
" does not restrict which input type to pass in or type to return. Under the "
"hood, when we call a PackedFunc, it packs the input arguments to TVMArgs on "
"stack, and gets the result back via TVMRetValue."

"Thanks to template tricks in C++, we can call a PackedFunc just like a "

"TVM provides a `minimum C API`_, which allows us to embed the PackedFunc "

"To keep the runtime minimum, we isolated the IR Object support from the "

msgstr ""

#: ../../_staging/arch/runtime.rst:149
msgid ""
"The overhead of calling into PackedFunc vs. a normal function is small, as "
"it is only saving a few values on the stack. So it is OK as long as we don't"

"Since TVM supports multiple types of devices, we need to support different "

"the argument in packed format and perform kernel launch. We also need to "
"patch up the driver API so that the exposed functions are threadsafe. So we "
"often need to implement these driver glues in C++ and expose them to the "

"PackedFunc is our answer."

"TVM defines the compiled object as `Module`_. The user can get the compiled "

"We introduced a base class, called `Object`_ to solve this problem. All the "
"language object in the compiler stack is a subclass of ``Object``. Each "
"object contains a string type_key that uniquely identifies the type of "
"object. We choose string instead of int as type key so new ``Object`` class "
"can be added in the decentralized fashion without adding the code back to "

"type_index at runtime for each type_key."

"Since usually one ``Object`` could be referenced in multiple places in the "
"language, we use a shared_ptr to keep track of reference. We use "
"``ObjectRef`` class to represent a reference to the ``Object``. We can "
"roughly view ``ObjectRef`` class as shared_ptr to the ``Object`` container. "
"We can also define subclass ``ObjectRef`` to hold each subtypes of "

"In the above examples, both ``Operation`` and ``Array<Expr>`` are ObjectRef."
" The VisitAttrs gives us a reflection API to visit each member of the "
