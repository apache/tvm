"`NNPACK <https://github.com/Maratyszcza/NNPACK>`_ is an acceleration package"
" for neural network computations, which can run on x86-64, ARMv7, or ARM64 "
"architecture CPUs. Using NNPACK, higher-level libraries like _MXNet_ can "
"speed up the execution on multi-core CPU computers, including laptops and "
"mobile devices."

"AS TVM already has natively tuned schedules, NNPACK is here mainly for "
"reference and comparison purpose. For regular use prefer native tuned TVM "

"TVM supports NNPACK for forward propagation (inference only) in convolution,"
" max-pooling, and fully-connected layers. In this document, we give a high "
"level overview of how to use NNPACK with TVM."

"The underlying implementation of NNPACK utilizes several acceleration "
"methods, including fft and winograd. These algorithms work better on some "
"special `batch size`, `kernel size`, and `stride` settings than on other, so"
" depending on the context, not all convolution, max-pooling, or fully-"
"connected layers can be powered by NNPACK. When favorable conditions for "
"running NNPACKS are not met,"
