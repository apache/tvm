"TVM contains structured error classes to indicate specific types of error. "
"Please raise a specific error type when possible, so that users can write "
"code to handle a specific error category if necessary. You can directly "
"raise the specific error object in python. In other languages like c++, you "
"simply add ``<ErrorType>:`` prefix to the error message(see below)."

"You can add ``<ErrorType>:`` prefix to your error message to raise an error "
"of the corresponding type. Note that you do not have to add a new type "
":py:class:`tvm.error.TVMError` will be raised by default when there is no "
"error type prefix in the message. This mechanism works for both "
"``LOG(FATAL)`` and ``ICHECK`` macros. The following code gives an example on"
" how to do so."

"As you can see in the above example, TVM's ffi system combines both the "
