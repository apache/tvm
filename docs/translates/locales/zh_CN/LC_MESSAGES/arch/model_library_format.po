"TVM traditionally exports generated libraries as Dynamic Shared Objects "
"(e.g. DLLs (Windows) or .so (linux)). Inferences can be performed using "
"those libraries by loading them into an executable using "
"``libtvm_runtime.so``. This process is very dependent on services provided "
"by traditional OS."

"For deployment to unconventional platforms (e.g. those lacking traditional "
"OS), TVM provides another output format, Model Library Format. Initially, "
"the microTVM project is the primary use case for this format. Should it "
"become useful in other use cases (and in particular, should it become "
"possible to export BYOC artifacts in Model Library Format), it could be used"
" as a general-purpose TVM export format.  Model Library Format is a tarball "
"containing a file for each piece of the TVM compiler output."
