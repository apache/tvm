"Apple BNNS library is a collection of functions that can be used to "
"construct neural networks for inference (and train). It’s supported in "
"macOS, iOS, tvOS, and watchOS. BNNS provides primitives executed on all CPU "
"supported on those platforms and optimized for high performance and low-"
"energy consumption. This integration will offload as many operators as "
"possible from Relay to BNNS."
