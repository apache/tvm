"The operator implementation for ARM CPU in TVM is written in template form. "
"The template has many tunable knobs (tile factor, vectorization, unrolling, "
"etc). We will tune all convolution and depthwise convolution operators in "
"the neural network. After tuning, we produce a log file which stores the "
"best knob values for all required operators. When the TVM compiler compiles "
"these operators, it will query this log file to get the best knob values."
