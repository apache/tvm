The documentation of tvm is generated with recommonmark and sphinx.

- A hosted version of doc is at http://docs.tvmlang.org
- pip install sphinx>=1.5.5 sphinx-gallery sphinx_rtd_theme matplotlib Image recommonmark
- Build tvm first in the root folder.
- To build locally, you need to enable USE_CUDA, USE_OPENCL, LLVM_CONFIG in config.mk and then type "make html" in this folder.
