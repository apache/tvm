Apache TVM Documentation
========================

Welcome to the documentation for Apache TVM, a deep learning compiler that
enables access to high-performance machine learning anywhere for everyone.
TVM's diverse community of hardware vendors, compiler engineers and ML
researchers work together to build a unified, programmable software stack, that
enriches the entire ML technology ecosystem and make it accessible to the wider
ML community. TVM empowers users to leverage community-driven ML-based
optimizations to push the limits and amplify the reach of their research and
development, which in turn raises the collective performance of all ML, while
driving its costs down.
