Deploy to Android
=================

Build model for Android Target
------------------------------

Relay compilation of model for android target could follow same approach like android_rpc.
The code below will save the compilation output which is required on android target.


.. code:: python

    lib.export_library("deploy_lib.so", ndk.create_shared)
    with open("deploy_graph.json", "w") as fo:
        fo.write(graph.json())
    with open("deploy_param.params", "wb") as fo:
        fo.write(runtime.save_param_dict(params))

deploy_lib.so, deploy_graph.json, deploy_param.params will go to android target.

TVM Runtime for Android Target
------------------------------

Refer `here <https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/main/apps/android_deploy/README.md#build-and-installation>`_ to build CPU/OpenCL version flavor TVM runtime for android target.
From android java TVM API to load model & execute can be referred at this `java <https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/main/apps/android_deploy/app/src/main/java/org/apache/tvm/android/demo/MainActivity.java>`_ sample source.
