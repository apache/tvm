Installing TVM
==============

Checkout to :ref:`install TVM from source <install-from-source>`. Installing
from source gives you the maximum flexibility to configure the build effectively from the official source releases.
If you are interested in deploying to mobile or embedded devices, you do not need to
install the entire TVM stack on your device. Instead, you only need the runtime and can install using the
:ref:`deployment and integration guide <deploy-and-integration>`.

If you would like to quickly try out TVM or run some demo and tutorials, you
can checkout :ref:`install from Docker <docker-images>`. You can also
tryout pre-built from third-party :doc:`TLCPack Python and Conda packages <tlcpack>`.
