Installing TVM
==============

TVM is still pre-1.0 release software, meaning that it is under active
development and is changing quickly. Because of this, it is best to
:ref:`install TVM from source <install_from_source>` to guarantee you
have the latest features and bug fixes. If you are interested in deploying to
mobile or embedded devices, you do not need to install the entire TVM stack on
your device. Instead, you only need the runtime and can install using the
:ref:`deployment and integration guide <deploy-and-integration>`.

If you would like to quickly try out TVM or run some demo and tutorials, you
can :ref:`install from Docker <docker-images>`, or install using the
third-party :doc:`TLCPack Python and Conda packages <tlcpack>`
