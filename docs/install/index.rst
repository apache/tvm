Installation
============
To install TVM, please read :ref:`install-from-source`.
If you are interested in deploying to mobile/embedded devices,
you do not need to install the entire tvm stack on your device,
instead, you only need the runtime, please read :ref:`deploy-and-integration`.
If you would like to quickly try out TVM or do demo/tutorials, checkout :ref:`docker-images`
