Docker Images
=============
We provide docker utility scripts to help developers to setup development environment.
They are also helpful run through TVM demo and tutorials.
We need `docker <https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/>`_ and
`nvidia-docker <https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker/>`_ if we want to use cuda.

Get a tvm source distribution or clone the github repo to get the auxiliary scripts

.. code:: bash

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/apache/incubator-tvm tvm


We can then use the following command to launch a docker image.

.. code:: bash

    /path/to/tvm/docker/bash.sh <image-name>

Here the image-name can be a local docker image name, e.g. `tvm.ci_cpu` after you have done the local build.

This auxiliary script does the following things:

- Mount current directory to /workspace
- Switch user to be the same user that calls the bash.sh (so you can read/write host system)
- Use the host-side network on Linux. Use the bridge network and expose port 8888 on macOS,
  because host networking driver isn't supported. (so you can use jupyter notebook)


Then you can start a jupyter notebook by typing

.. code:: bash

   jupyter notebook

You might see an error ``OSError: [Errno 99] Cannot assign requested address`` when starting
a jupyter notebook on macOS. You can change the binding IP address by

.. code:: bash

   jupyter notebook --ip=0.0.0.0

Note that on macOS, because we use bridge network, jupyter notebook will be reportedly running
at an URL like ``http://{container_hostname}:8888/?token=...``. You should replace the ``container_hostname``
with ``localhost`` when pasting it into browser.


Docker Source
-------------
Check out `The docker source <https://github.com/apache/incubator-tvm/tree/main/docker>`_ if you are interested in
building your own docker images.


Run the following command to build the docker image.

.. code:: bash

    /path/to/tvm/docker/build.sh <image-name>


You can find some un-official thirdparty prebuilt images.
These images are used for test purposes and are NOT of the ASF release.
