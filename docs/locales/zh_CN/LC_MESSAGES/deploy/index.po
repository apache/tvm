"A model (optimized or not by TVM) can be cross compiled by TVM for "
"different architectures such as ``aarch64`` on a ``x64_64`` host. Once "

"In the example :ref:`above <build-tvm-runtime-on-target-device>` the "
"runtime library was compiled on a Raspberry Pi. Producing the runtime "
"library can be done much faster on hosts that have high performace "
"processors with ample resources (such as laptops, workstation) compared "
"to a target devices such as a Raspberry Pi. In-order to cross compile the"
" runtime the toolchain for the target device must be installed. After "
"installing the correct toolchain, the main difference compared to "
"compiling natively is to pass some additional command line argument to "
"cmake that specify a toolchain to be used. For reference building the TVM"
" runtime library on a modern laptop (using 8 threads) for ``aarch64`` "
"takes around 20 seconds vs ~10 min to build the runtime on a Raspberry Pi"
