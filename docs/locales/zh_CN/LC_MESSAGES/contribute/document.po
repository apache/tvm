"We use the `Sphinx <http://sphinx-doc.org>`_ for the main documentation. "
"Sphinx support both the reStructuredText and markdown. When possible, we "
"encourage to use reStructuredText as it has richer features. Note that "
"the python doc-string and tutorials allow you to embed reStructuredText "
"syntax."

"We use `numpydoc <https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ format to"
" document the function and classes. The following snippet gives an "
"example docstring. We always document all the public functions, when "
"necessary, provide an usage example of the features we support(as shown "
"below)."

"Be careful to leave blank lines between sections of your documents. In "
"the above case, there has to be a blank line before `Parameters`, "
"`Returns` and `Examples` in order for the doc to be built correctly. To "
"add a new function to the doc, we need to add the `sphinx.autodoc "
"<http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/ext/autodoc.html>`_ rules to the "
"`docs/api/python "
"<https://github.com/apache/tvm/tree/main/docs/api/python>`_). You can "
"refer to the existing files under this folder on how to add the "
"functions."

"explanatory. One thing that worth noting is that the comment blocks are "
"written in reStructuredText instead of markdown so be aware of the "

"The tutorial code will run on our build server to generate the document "
"page. So we may have a restriction like not being able to access a remote"
" Raspberry Pi, in such case add a flag variable to the tutorial (e.g. "
"`use_rasp`) and allow users to easily switch to the real device by "
"changing one flag. Then use the existing environment to demonstrate the "
