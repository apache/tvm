"Open source code is maintained by a community with diverse backgrounds, "
"interests, and goals. Hence it is important to provide clear, documented "
"and maintainable code and processes. Code reviews are a shepherding "
"process used to collectively spot potential problems, improve quality of "
"the code, and educate both contributors and reviewers about the code base"
" and its assumptions. It is also one mechanism to ensure there are "
"multiple people who can maintain a related piece of code together. "
"Contributors are encouraged to polish the code to a reviewable state "
"before requesting reviews. This is especially important for committer "
"candidates, as committers are expected to participate in not only writing"
" code but also reviewing it."
