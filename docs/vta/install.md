VTA Installation Guide
======================

We present three installation guides, each extending on the previous one:
1. VTA simulation-only installation
2. VTA hardware testing setup with the [Pynq](http://www.pynq.io/) FPGA development board
3. VTA hardware compilation tool chain installation

## VTA Simulation-Only Installation

Please follow the guide on install TVM from source.
VTA simulator is library is built by default along with TVM.
You only have to add vta to your python path.

```bash
export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/vta/python:${PYTHONPATH}
```

### Testing your VTA Simulation Setup

Finally to ensure that you've properly installed the VTA package, we can run simple unit tests and the ResNet-18 inference example.

Let's first run the 2D convolution test bench that will only run the ResNet-18 convolution layers.

```bash
python vta/tests/python/integration/test_benchmark_topi_conv2d.py
```

> Note: You'll notice that for every convolution layer, the throughput gets reported in GOPS. These numbers are actually the computational throughput that the simulator achieves, by evaluating the convolution in software. You can also try out other tutorials.


### Advanced Configuration

VTA is a generic configurable hardware. The configuration is specified by a `vta_config.json` under root of the TVM folder.
This file provides an architectural specification of the VTA accelerator that can be understood by both the TVM compiler stack and the VTA hardware stack.
It also specifies the TVM compiler target. When `TARGET` is set to `sim`, it tells the TVM compiler to execute the TVM workloads on the VTA simulator.
You can modify the content to reconfigure VTA to a different mode. To do so,

```bash
cd <tvm root>
cp vta/config/vta_config.json vta_config.json
edit vta_config.json
make vta
```

## VTA Pynq-Based Testing Setup

This second guide extends the *VTA Simulation-Only Installation* guide above to allow FPGA-based hardware tests of the full TVM and VTA software-hardware stack.
In terms of hardware components you'll need:
* The [Pynq](http://www.pynq.io/) FPGA development board which can be acquired for $200, or $150 for academics from [Digilent](https://store.digilentinc.com/pynq-z1-python-productivity-for-zynq/).
* An Ethernet-to-USB adapter to connect the Pynq board to your development computer.
* An 8+GB micro SD card the (can be ordered with the Pynq dev kit).
* An AC to DC 12V 3A power adapter (can be ordered with the Pynq dev kit).

This guide includes:
1. Pynq board setup instructions
2. Pynq-side RPC server build and deployment
3. Revisiting the test examples from the *VTA Simulation-Only Installation* guide, this time executing on the Pynq board

### Pynq Board Setup

Setup your Pynq board based on the *Getting Started* tutorial for the [Pynq board](http://pynq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html). You should follow the instructions up to and including the *Turning On the PYNQ-Z1* steps (no need to pursue *Getting Started* tutorial beyond this point).
* Make sure that you've downloaded the latest Pynq image, PYNQ-Z1 v2.1 (released 21 Feb 2018), and have imaged your SD card with it.
* For this particular setup, follow the ["Connect to a Computer"](http://pynq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html#connect-to-a-computer) Ethernet setup instructions.
  * To be able to talk to the board, make sure to [assign your computer a static IP address](http://pynq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/appendix.html#assign-your-computer-a-static-ip)

Once the board is powered on and connected to your development host machine, try connecting to it to make sure you've properly set up your Pynq board:
```bash
# To connect to the Pynq board use the [username, password] combo: [xilinx, xilinx]
ssh xilinx@192.168.2.99
```

### Pynq-Side RPC Server Build & Deployment

Because the direct board-to-computer connection prevents the board from directly accessing the internet, we'll need to mount the Pynq's file system to your development machine's file system with [sshfs](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-sshfs-to-mount-remote-file-systems-over-ssh). Next we directly clone the VTA repository into the mountpoint from your development machine.

```bash
mkdir <mountpoint>
sshfs xilinx@192.168.2.99:/home/xilinx <mountpoint>
cd <mountpoint>
git clone --recursive https://github.com/dmlc/tvm
# When finished, you can leave the moutpoint and unmount the directory
cd ~
sudo umount <mountpoint>
```

Now that we've cloned the VTA repository in the Pynq's file system, we can ssh into it and launch the build of the TVM-based RPC server.
The build process should take roughly 5 minutes.

```bash
ssh xilinx@192.168.2.99
# Build TVM runtime library (takes 5 mins)
cd /home/xilinx/tvm
mkdir build
cp cmake/config.cmake build/.
# copy pynq specific configuration
cp vta/config/pynq_sample.json build/vta_config.json
cd build
cmake ..
make runtime vta -j2
# Build VTA RPC server (takes 1 min)
cd ..
sudo ./apps/pynq_rpc/start_rpc_server.sh # pw is 'xilinx'
```

Note that one key difference between the simulator build is that we changed the VTA configuration
to be `vta/config/pynq_sample.json`, which specifies PYNQ as target.

You should see the following being displayed when starting the RPC server. In order to run the next examples, you'll need to leave the RPC server running in an `ssh` session.
```
INFO:root:RPCServer: bind to 0.0.0.0:9091
```

Tips regarding the Pynq RPC Server:
* The RPC server should be listening on port `9091`. If not, an earlier process might have terminated unexpectedly and it's recommended in this case to just reboot the Pynq, and re-run the RPC server.
* To kill the RPC server, just send the `Ctrl + c` command. You can re-run it with `sudo ./apps/pynq_rpc/start_rpc_server.sh`.
* If unresponsive, the board can be rebooted by power-cycling it with the physical power switch.

### Testing your VTA Pynq-based Hardware Setup

Before running the examples you'll need to configure your environment as follows:
```bash
export VTA_PYNQ_RPC_HOST=192.168.2.99
export VTA_PYNQ_RPC_PORT=9091
```

In addition, you'll need to edit the `vta_config.json` file to indicate that we are targeting the Pynq platform, by setting the `TARGET` field to the `"pynq"` value. Alternatively, you can copy the default `make/config.json` into the VTA root.
> Note: in contrast to our simulation setup, there are no libraries to compile on the host side since the host offloads all of the computation to the Pynq board.

```bash
cd <tvm root>
cp vta/config/pynq_sample.json .
```

This time again, we will run the 2D convolution testbench. But beforehand, we'll need to program the Pynq's own FPGA with a VTA bitstream, and build the VTA runtime on the Pynq via RPC. The following `test_program_rpc.py` script will perform two operations:
* FPGA programming, by downloading a pre-compiled bitstream from a [VTA bitstream repository](https://github.com/uwsaml/vta-distro) that matches the default `config.json` configuration set by the host, and sending it over to the Pynq via RPC to program the Pynq's FPGA.
* Runtime building on the Pynq, which needs to be run everytime the `config.json` configuration is modified. This ensures that the VTA software runtime that generates the accelerator's executable via just-in-time (JIT) compilation matches the specifications of the VTA design that is programmed on the FPGA. The build process takes about 30 seconds to complete.

```bash
python tests/python/pynq/test_program_rpc.py
```

> Tip: You can track progress of the FPGA programming and the runtime rebuilding steps by looking at the RPC server's logging messages in your Pynq `ssh` session.

We are now ready to run the 2D convolution testbench for the ResNet-15 workload in hardware.

```bash
python tests/python/pynq/test_benchmark_conv2d.py
```

The performance metrics measured on the Pynq board will be reported for each convolutional layer.

## VTA Hardware Toolchain Installation

This third and last guide allows users to generate custom VTA bitstreams using free-to-use Xilinx compilation toolchains.

This guide includes:
1. Xilinx toolchain installation (for Linux)
2. Custom VTA bitstream compilation
3. Running the end to end ResNet-18 test with the new bitstream

### Xilinx Toolchain Installation

We recommend using `Vivado 2017.1` since our scripts have been tested to work on this version of the Xilinx toolchains. Our guide is written for Linux installation.

You’ll need to install Xilinx’ FPGA compilation toolchain, [Vivado HL WebPACK 2017.1](https://www.xilinx.com/products/design-tools/vivado.html), which a license-free version of the Vivado HLx toolchain.

#### Obtaining and Launching the Vivado GUI Installer

1. Go to the [download webpage](https://www.xilinx.com/support/download.html), and download the Linux Self Extracting Web Installer for Vivado HL 2017.1 WebPACK and Editions.
2. You’ll have to sign in with a Xilinx account. This requires a Xilinx account creation that will take 2 minutes.
3. Complete the Name and Address Verification by clicking “Next”, and you will get the opportunity to download a binary file, called `Xilinx_Vivado_SDK_2017.1_0415_1_Lin64.bin`.
4. Now that the file is downloaded, go to your `Downloads` directory, and change the file permissions so it can be executed:
```bash
chmod u+x Xilinx_Vivado_SDK_2017.1_0415_1_Lin64.bin
```
5. Now you can execute the binary:
```bash
./Xilinx_Vivado_SDK_2017.1_0415_1_Lin64.bin
```

#### Xilinx Vivado GUI Installer Steps

At this point you've launched the Vivado 2017.1 Installer GUI program.

1. Click “Next” on the *Welcome* screen.
2. Enter your Xilinx User Credentials under “User Authentication” and select the “Download and Install Now” before clicking “Next” on the *Select Install Type* screen.
3. Accept all terms before clicking on “Next” on the *Accept License Agreements* screen.
4. Select the “Vivado HL WebPACK” before clicking on “Next” on the *Select Edition to Install* screen.
5. Under the *Vivado HL WebPACK* screen, before hitting “Next", check the following options (the rest should be unchecked):
   * Design Tools -> Vivado Design Suite -> Vivado
   * Design Tools -> Vivado Design Suite -> Vivado High Level Synthesis
   * Devices -> Production Services -> SoCs -> Zynq-7000 Series
6. Your total download size should be about 3GB and the amount of Disk Space Required 13GB.
7. Set the installation directory before clicking “Next” on the *Select Destination Directory* screen. It might highlight some paths as red - that’s because the installer doesn’t have the permission to write to that directory. In that case select a path that doesn’t require special write permissions (e.g. in your home directory).
8. Hit “Install” under the *Installation Summary* screen.
9. An *Installation Progress Window* will pop-up to track progress of the download and the installation.
10. This process will take about 20-30 minutes depending on your connection speed.
11. A pop-up window will inform you that the installation completed successfully. Click "OK".
12. Finally the *Vivado License Manager* will launch. Select "Get Free ISE WebPACK, ISE/Vivado IP or PetaLinux License" and click "Connect Now" to complete the license registration process.

#### Environment Setup

The last step is to update your `~/.bashrc` with the following lines. This will include all of the Xilinx binary paths so you can launch compilation scripts from the command line.
```bash
# Xilinx Vivado 2017.1 environmentexport XILINX_VIVADO=/home/moreau/Xilinx/SDx/2017.1/Vivado
export XILINX_VIVADO=/home/moreau/Xilinx/SDx/2017.1/Vivado
export XILINX_HLS=/home/moreau/Xilinx/SDx/2017.1/Vivado_HLS
export XILINX_SDK=/home/moreau/Xilinx/SDx/2017.1/SDK
export PATH=${XILINX_VIVADO}/bin:${PATH}
export PATH=${XILINX_HLS}/bin:${PATH}
export PATH=${XILINX_SDK}/bin:${PATH}
```

### Custom VTA Bitstream Compilation

High-level parameters are listed under `tvm/vta/config/vta_config.json` and can be customized by the user. For this custom VTA Bitstream Compilation exercise, we'll change the frequency of our design, so it can be clocked a little faster.
* Set the `HW_FREQ` field to `142`. The Pynq board supports 100, 142, 167 and 200MHz clocks. Note that the higher the frequency, the harder it will be to close timing. Increasing the frequency can lead to timing violation and thus faulty hardware.
* Set the `HW_CLK_TARGET` to `6`. This parameters refers to the target clock period in ns passed to HLS - a lower clock period leads to more aggressive pipelining to achieve timing closure at higher frequencies. Technically a 142MHz clock would require a 7ns target, but we intentionally lower the clock target to 6ns to more aggressively pipeline our design.

Bitstream generation is driven by a top-level `Makefile` under `<vta root>/hardware/xilinx/`.

If you just want to simulate the VTA design in software emulation to make sure that it is functional, enter:
```bash
cd <vta root>/hardware/xilinx
make ip MODE=sim
```

If you just want to generate the HLS-based VTA IP cores without launching the entire design place and route, enter:
```bash
make ip
```
You'll be able to view the HLS synthesis reports under `<vta root>/build/hardware/xilinx/hls/<configuration>/<block>/solution0/syn/report/<block>_csynth.rpt`
> Note: The `<configuration>` name is a string that summarizes the VTA configuration parameters specified in the `config.json`. The `<block>` name refers to the specific module in the VTA pipeline.

Finally to run the full hardware compilation and generate the bitstream, run:

```bash
make
```

This process is lenghty, and can take around up to an hour to complete depending on your machine's specs. We recommend setting the `VTA_HW_COMP_THREADS` variable in the Makefile to take full advantage of all the cores on your development machine.

Once the compilation completes, the generated bitstream can be found under `<vta root>/build/hardware/xilinx/vivado/<configuration>/export/vta.bit`.

### Use the Custom Bitstream

We can change the FPGA bitstream by simply change the bistream path to the configuring API.

```python
vta.program_fpga(remote, bitstream="<vta root>/build/hardware/xilinx/vivado/<configuration>/export/vta.bit")
```

Instead of downloading the bitstream from the bitstream repository, the programmer will instead use the custom bitstream you just generated, which is a VTA design clocked at a higher frequency.
Do you observe a noticable performance increase on the ImageNet inference workload?
