NNPACK Contrib Installation
===========================

`NNPACK <https://github.com/Maratyszcza/NNPACK>`_ is an acceleration package
for neural network computations, which can run on x86-64, ARMv7, or ARM64 architecture CPUs.
Using NNPACK, higher-level libraries like _MXNet_ can speed up
the execution on multi-core CPU computers, including laptops and mobile devices.

.. note::

   AS TVM already has natively tuned schedules, NNPACK is here mainly for reference and comparison purpose.
   For regular use prefer native tuned TVM implementation.

TVM supports NNPACK for forward propagation (inference only) in convolution, max-pooling, and fully-connected layers.
In this document, we give a high level overview of how to use NNPACK with TVM.

Conditions
----------

The underlying implementation of NNPACK utilizes several acceleration methods,
including fft and winograd.
These algorithms work better on some special `batch size`, `kernel size`, and `stride` settings than on other,
so depending on the context, not all convolution, max-pooling, or fully-connected layers can be powered by NNPACK.
When favorable conditions for running NNPACKS are not met,

NNPACK only supports Linux and OS X systems. Windows is not supported at present.

Build/Install NNPACK
--------------------

If the trained model meets some conditions of using NNPACK,
you can build TVM with NNPACK support.
Follow these simple steps:

uild NNPACK shared library with the following commands. TVM will link NNPACK dynamically.

Note: The following NNPACK installation instructions have been tested on Ubuntu 16.04.

Build Ninja
~~~~~~~~~~~

NNPACK need a recent version of Ninja. So we need to install ninja from source.

.. code:: bash

   git clone git://github.com/ninja-build/ninja.git
   cd ninja
   ./configure.py --bootstrap


Set the environment variable PATH to tell bash where to find the ninja executable. For example, assume we cloned ninja on the home directory ~. then we can added the following line in ~/.bashrc.


.. code:: bash

   export PATH="${PATH}:~/ninja"


Build NNPACK
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The new CMAKE version of NNPACK download `Peach <https://github.com/Maratyszcza/PeachPy>`_ and other dependencies alone

Note: at least on OS X, running `ninja install` below will overwrite googletest libraries installed in `/usr/local/lib`. If you build googletest again to replace the nnpack copy, be sure to pass `-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON` to `cmake`.

.. code:: bash

   git clone --recursive https://github.com/Maratyszcza/NNPACK.git
   cd NNPACK
   # Add PIC option in CFLAG and CXXFLAG to build NNPACK shared library
   sed -i "s|gnu99|gnu99 -fPIC|g" CMakeLists.txt
   sed -i "s|gnu++11|gnu++11 -fPIC|g" CMakeLists.txt
   mkdir build
   cd build
   # Generate ninja build rule and add shared library in configuration
   cmake -G Ninja -D BUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON ..
   ninja
   sudo ninja install

   # Add NNPACK lib folder in your ldconfig
   echo "/usr/local/lib" > /etc/ld.so.conf.d/nnpack.conf
   sudo ldconfig


Build TVM with NNPACK support
-----------------------------

.. code:: bash

   git clone --recursive https://github.com/apache/tvm tvm

- Set `set(USE_NNPACK ON)` in config.cmake.
- Set `NNPACK_PATH` to the $(YOUR_NNPACK_INSTALL_PATH)

after configuration use `make` to build TVM


.. code:: bash

   make
