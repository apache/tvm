Control flow
============

Control flow is ``if``, the loop family, and ``while`` — each maps to the obvious
CUDA.

if
--

A Python ``if`` / ``else`` becomes a CUDA ``if`` / ``else``. Guard work by a
thread/lane comparison, or elect one lane in each active warp with
``Tx.cuda.elect_sync()``:

.. code-block:: python

    if tx < 128:
        A[tx] = A[tx] * Tx.float32(2.0)
    else:
        A[tx] = A[tx] + Tx.float32(1.0)

    if (warp_id == issuer_warp) & Tx.cuda.elect_sync():
        ...                              # one lane from the designated warp

.. code-block:: c++

    if (((int)threadIdx.x) < 128) {
      A_ptr[tx] = A_ptr[tx] * 2.0f;
    } else {
      A_ptr[tx] = A_ptr[tx] + 1.0f;
    }

For an expression-level choice (no branch), use ``Tx.if_then_else(cond, a, b)``.

loop
----

Loops come in four flavors; a plain Python ``range`` becomes ``Tx.serial``:

- ``Tx.serial(n)`` — a sequential loop (ptxas may still unroll it).
- ``Tx.unroll(n)`` — marks a loop for full unrolling by the ``UnrollLoop``
  lowering pass.
- ``Tx.vectorized(n)`` — a vectorized loop.
- ``Tx.grid(*extents)`` — a nested loop nest.

``break`` / ``continue`` work inside loops.

.. code-block:: python

    for i, j in Tx.grid(8, 8):
        B[i, j] = Tx.max(A[i, j], Tx.float32(0.0))

.. code-block:: c++

    for (int i = 0; i < 8; ++i)
      for (int j = 0; j < 8; ++j)
        B_ptr[i * 8 + j] = max(A_ptr[i * 8 + j], 0.0f);

After the TIRx lowering pipeline, ``Tx.unroll(4)`` is expanded to four
straight-line statements with no loop.

while
-----

A ``while`` loop runs until its condition is false. Use a mutable scalar counter
(see :doc:`buffers`):

.. code-block:: python

    i: Tx.int32 = 0
    while i < 64:
        A[i] = A[i] + Tx.float32(1.0)
        i += 1

It lowers to a ``while (1)`` with an early-exit ``break`` (the counter is a
one-element local buffer that the CUDA toolchain may promote to a register):

.. code-block:: c++

    int i_ptr[1];
    i_ptr[0] = 0;
    while (1) {
      if (!(i_ptr[0] < 64)) { break; }
      A_ptr[i_ptr[0]] = A_ptr[i_ptr[0]] + 1.0f;
      i_ptr[0] = i_ptr[0] + 1;
    }
