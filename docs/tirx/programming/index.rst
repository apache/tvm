Programming Guide
=================

This guide explains how to write, compile, and inspect TIRx kernels.  Start
with the CUDA guide for the core language and native programming model, then
use tensor layouts and tile primitives to express reusable tile-level work.

The examples use a single alias for the TIRx TVMScript dialect::

   from tvm.script import tirx as Tx

Core language constructs are written as ``Tx.*``.  Backend-specific helpers
and direct CUDA instructions are available through ``Tx.cuda.*`` and
``Tx.ptx.*``.  Reusable tile operations are written as ``Tx.tile.*``.

   ../layout
