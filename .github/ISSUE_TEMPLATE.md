TVM Github Issue Guideline
---------------------------

Thanks for participating TVM community! We use [TVM Discuss forum](https://discuss.tvmlang.org) for any general questions and discussions. When in doubt, you are always welcomed to post on the forum first :)

The issue tracker is used for actionable items such as feature proposals, roadmaps and bug tracking. We close issues that are inactive for a period of time. We adopt this policy so that we won't lost track of actionable issues that may fall at the bottom of the pile. Feel free to reopen a new one if you feel there is an additional problem that need attention when an old one get closed.

For bug reports, to help the developer act on the issues, please include description of your environment, possibly a minimum script to reproduce the problem.

For feature proposals, list clear, small actionable items so we can track the progress of the change.
