# microTVM

microTVM is the effort that allows TVM to build and execute models on bare-metal microcontrollers.

The `pyproject.toml` file in this directory can be used to create a
[Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) Python environment with all of the required
dependencies installed for running microTVM. To use it, run:

```
$ poetry lock && poetry install
$ poetry shell
```
