# microTVM Reference Virtual Machines


microTVM is the effort to allow TVM to build and execute models on bare-metal microcontrollers.
These Virtual Machines are used to reproduce results and bugs when using microTVM with real
physical hardware. Note that they are not used to run Continuous Integration regression tests--
those are instead run by the QEMU container (they run against an emulator, rather than real
hardware).


See the "microTVM Reference Virtual Machines" tutorial for information on how to use these.
