This directory contains code to create code for the Gemmini accelerator using microTVM. These tests are then executed on the Spike RISC-V ISA simulator.

In order to use this correctly, the Spike simulator has to be installed. This can be done by following the steps found on the [Chipyard](https://chipyard.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) repository. The instructions to also install the patch of the Spike simulator that adds the Gemmini functional simulator can be found in the [Gemmini](https://github.com/ucb-bar/gemmini) repository.
