# microTVM Arduino Reference Virtual Machine

This directory contains setup files for Arduino virtual machine used for testing
microTVM platforms that are supported by [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/).

## VM Information for Developers
Arduino VM is published under [tlcpack](https://app.vagrantup.com/tlcpack).
Here is a list of different release versions and their tools.

(none currently)

## Supported Arduino Boards
This RVM has been tested and is known to work with these boards:
- Adafruit Metro M4
- Adafruit Pybadge
- Arduino Due
- Arduino Nano 33 BLE
- Feather S2
- Sony Spresense
- Wio Terminal

However, the RVM *should* work with any Arduino with sufficient memory, provided
its core is installed in `base-box/base_box_provision.sh`.

Note that this RVM does not work with the Teensy boards, even though they are
supported by microTVM. This is because arduino-cli does not support Teensy
boards (https://github.com/arduino/arduino-cli/issues/700)/).
