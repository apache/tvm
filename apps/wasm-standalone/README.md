# WebAssembly Standalone for Deep Learning Framework with TVM Runtime

#### Experimental notice: This project is still *experimental* and only serves as a proof of concept for running deep learning frameworks on [WebAssembly runtime](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime) with [TVM stack](https://tvm.apache.org/).

## Motivation

<img src="https://github.com/dmlc/web-data/raw/master/tvm/tutorial/tvm_support_list.png" alt="TVM hardware support" width="600"/>

As demonstrated in TVM runtime [tutorials](https://tvm.apache.org/docs/tutorials/get_started/relay_quick_start.html), TVM already supports WASM as the optional hardware backend, so we can leverage the features of WebAssembly (portability, security) and TVM runtime (domain-specific, optimization) to build a flexible and auto-optimized graph compiler for all deep learning frameworks.

## Framework Landscape

The figures below demonstrate the whole landscape of running deep learning frameworks on WASM runtime with TVM compiler stack.

## Project Status

This project should be considered **experimental** at the very early stage, all rich features are under active development. Here is the current operator support matrix:

| Model Name | Status |
| ---------- | ------ |
| ResNet50 | ✔️ |
| LeNet | <center>&mdash;</center> |

**NOTICE**: Currently this project is ONLY tested on Ubuntu system, so `Ubuntu 16.04+` should be prepared as the testing environment.

## PoC Guidelines

### Pre-installation

* Rust

    Before running this demo, please make sure [Rust](#system-packages-install) has been installed.

    After Rust installed, execute the code below to add `wasm32-wasi` target:
    ```shell
    rustup target add wasm32-wasi
    ```

* TVM

    Please follow TVM [installations](https://tvm.apache.org/docs/install/index.html) for the detailed instruction.

* LLVM

    `LLVM 10.0` or later is REQUIRED.

### Build ResNet50 model

- Build DL library in the WebAssembly format.

  - Download model

    ```
    cd wasm-graph/tools && wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/onnx-model-zoo/resnet/resnet50v1/resnet50v1.onnx
    ```

  - Compile

    ```
    LLVM_AR=llvm-ar-10 python ./build_graph_lib.py -O3 ./resnet50v1.onnx
    ```

### Build wasm-graph package

```shell
cd wasm-graph && cargo build --release
cp ./target/wasm32-wasi/release/wasm_graph.wasm ./lib/wasm_graph_resnet50.wasm
```

### Test

Before running this demo, please make sure [`Rust`](#system-packages-install) has been installed.

Next run the command below to install the runtime package for testing (`rust` REQUIRED):

```shell
cd wasm-runtime/tests/test_graph_resnet50 && cargo build
```

Check the usage of `test_graph_resnet50`:

```shell
~# ./target/debug/test_graph_resnet50 -h

Usage: ./target/debug/test_graph_resnet50 [options]

Options:
    -g, --wasm-graph-file FILE_PATH
                        set the path to wasm graph file
    -i, --input-data-file FILE_PATH
                        set the path to input image file
    -l, --label-class-file FILE_PATH
                        set the path to label class file
    -h, --help          print this help menu
```

Next perform model inference using these commands below:
```
$ cp ../../../wasm-graph/lib/wasm_graph_resnet50.wasm ./
$ wget -O cat.png https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet.js/blob/master/data/cat.png?raw=true
$ wget -O synset.csv https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kazum/tvm-wasm/master/synset.csv
$ ./target/debug/test_graph_resnet50 -g ./wasm_graph_resnet50.wasm -i ./cat.png -l ./synset.csv
original image dimensions: (256, 256)
resized image dimensions: (224, 224)
input image belongs to the class `tabby, tabby cat`
```

## Future Work

### More networks support
TODO

### Performance benchmark

We are working on several improvements on performances:
* WebAssembly simd128 support (**Done**)
* Auto-tvm enhancement for llvm target

### Native TVM Rust runtime support
TODO

## Appendix

### System packages install

* Rust (latest version)

    If you are running Windows, to install Rust, download and run the [RUST-INIT.EXE](https://win.rustup.rs/), and then follow the onscreen instructions.

    If you are a Linux user, run the following in your terminal, then follow the on-screen instructions to install Rust.

    ```shell
